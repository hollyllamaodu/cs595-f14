Is the iPhone 6 Plus bendable?

   NEW YORK (CNNMoney)

If you just bought an iPhone 6 Plus and you like to wear tight pants, beware.
...maybe.

   There are reports circulating online claiming that the new, larger
   iPhone bends when owners carried them in their pockets for long periods
   of time. Ironically, the reports came the same day that [30]smartphone
   warranty provider SquareTrade called the [31]iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus
   the "most durable smartphones ever."

   It's impossible to say whether reports of bending iPhone 6 Pluses are a
   sign of a systemic design flaw, a defect in a limited number of devices
   or even a hoax. CNNMoney was not able to replicate the issue in several
   attempts to bend the iPhone 6 Plus.

   Apple ([32]AAPL, [33]Tech30) did not immediately respond to a request
   for comment.

   One report Apple blog [35]MacRumors shows photos of iPhone 6 Plus
   devices that appear slightly warped. The owner claimed the curvature
   appeared after carrying the device in the front pocket of his pants for
   several hours.

   Other reports have been posted to Twitter ([36]TWTR, [37]Tech30) under
   the hashtag #BendGate -- although many are clearly Photoshopped images.

   YouTube video posted by Unbox Therapy shows a man appearing to bend the
   iPhone 6 Plus using his hands to apply pressure to a point near the
   buttons on the side of the device.

   Lewis Hilsenteger, the Internet personality who posted the video,
   insisted that bending the device was just a matter of strength.

   "Grab it in the middle with the glass facing out and give it everything
   you have," he told CNNMoney in an email. "It'll bend."

   On Twitter, some iPhone fans suggested that the jumbo smartphone is
   just not compatible with skinny jeans. There's also a camp that argues
   that if you own a $750 smartphone, you shouldn't sit on it.

   Last year, there were some reports that the iPhone 5S could bend. So
   this isn't an entirely new issue for Apple -- if the reports are
   accurate.

   CNNMoney received a test model and several staffers tried and failed to
   change its shape using brute force. (Though we might not have been
   trying hard enough: We are required to return the device to Apple in
   working condition.)

   The iPhone 6 Plus is significantly larger and thinner than the
   traditional iPhone. It's also made of aluminum, which is a naturally
   flexible material.
