Can Middle Managers Innovate? 3 Ways To Engage The Center Of Your
Organization

   [47]Comment Now
   [48]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Long live the middle manager. Operating behind the scenes in roles
   often unrecognized by senior leadership, [49]this unique group
   constitutes 7.6% of the US workforce  – some [50]10.8 million people.
   An integral part of the ethos that makes companies excel, middle
   managers prove pivotal to the successful launch of any new product,
   service, or business platform. So crucial is the role of the middle
   manager to daily operations that this cadre of workers is described by
   Andrew McAfee, principal research scientist at the Center for Digital
   Business at MIT, as [51]“the most durable tech-proof profession out
   there.” In other words, robots can never replace them.

   As today’s companies morph away from the traditional ‘pyramid
   structure’ that characterized the Industrial Age, the notion of who a
   middle manager is – and what they do – is changing. Technology is
   flattening long-standing hierarchies that made it easy to discern whose
   customer belonged to which functional area, and which group inside a
   company was driving new initiatives. Now, alongside the technology
   savvy required to link people and information,  [52]problem-solving and
   execution remain the “intensely human skills” middle managers must
   possess.

   Middle Managers A Unique Breed

   Just who is a middle manager in the digital age? Think sales directors,
   property analysts, store managers, merchandise managers, customer
   service supervisors, and general managers. [53]Often these individuals
   remain invisible and unsung, [54]sandwiched between a Vice President on
   the upper edge and customer-facing employees on the lower edge. Their
   role has traditionally been to ‘do’ and to ‘execute’ plans and
   strategies passed along from senior ranks in the firm. Yet
   historically, they’ve also been required to develop new talent and
   coordinate initiatives with co-workers across multiple teams, making
   them strong at collaboration and communication. Middle managers
   represent an essential layer of any company, turning top-line strategy
   into action. Notes Alison Hooker, chief talent development officer for
   EY LLC (formerly Ernst & Young), [55]“Without them being able to be
   responsive, the organization kind of falls apart.”

   Middle managers often oversee processes as well as supervise people,
   and during the past several years they’ve witnessed the ranks of their
   employees shrink. Although middle managers themselves were less reduced
   by the Great Recession than other tiers of management because of their
   hands-on role, [56]engagement fell more sharply among middle managers
   than all other groups.  An engineer with a food services company
   comments, [57]being a middle manager “is a more complex job than it
   used to be,” requiring oversight of technical processes, data analysis,
   and productivity improvements.

   Engaging [58]Change Agents In The Middle

   Can a group that has primarily been incentivized to execute rather than
   ‘think creatively’ impact how innovation prospers in an organization?
   Should middle managers even be asked to innovate? The answer is a
   resounding ‘yes.’ If middle level employees lack connection to the
   innovation process, they become less attractive candidates for
   promotion, risk defection to rival firms, and slow organizational
   agility as customer demands increase.

   So, rather than considering middle managers just a tier of ‘doers,’
   here are three ways to engage them as innovation contributors in your
   organization.

   1 – Consider middle managers a key group for establishing technological
   relevance within the company. Today, when asking employees to engage in
   innovation means giving them access to technology platforms that
   provide connectivity both inside and outside your company. It means
   training them to use technology tools in ways that add productivity to
   their jobs. For example at Cisco, every employee has access to the
   company’s Telepresence system. They can request conference time using
   sophisticated touch panels that schedule discussions across time zones,
   looping in senior leaders or outside resources (such as suppliers or
   customers) very easily. This encourages deepened collaborative behavior
   and rich dialogue using technology. Organizations can also promote use
   of apps that simplify record-keeping or reduce flows of required
   documentation. By encouraging technology usage, companies stay
   technology-relevant, and prompt middle manager behaviors that help them
   better navigate data and communications – boons to the innovation
   process.

   2 – Reshape the middle of your organization by valuing learning
   competencies rather than simply incentivizing raw efficiency. Middle
   managers are no longer operating in a world where ‘being in the middle’
   means having cut and dried responsibilities. This group thrives on
   being collaborative and connected, responding to crises through a
   combination of expertise and human-to-human savvy. Leverage this
   reality by [59]reshaping the ‘middle’ of your organization as a place
   where managers also learn collaboratively. Rather than creating a layer
   of workers that function as rats on a wheel, incentivize middle
   managers to ask new questions that competitors are not asking. For
   example at Macy’s, to ensure their managers sustain engagement and new
   thinking in a fast-changing industry, the company uses simulations to
   help this group envision new kinds of questions and problems that can
   arise in daily decision-making – even talent development.
   [60]Simulations enable middle level employees to imagine new customer
   situations that stretch thinking in ways that go beyond raw tasks.
   Exercising mental muscles that allow them to ask new questions prepares
   middle managers for learning rather than just execution.

   3 – Offer opportunities that aid middle managers in becoming
   ‘disruption ready.’ GE CMO Beth Comstock, in commenting on recent
   findings from [61]GE’s Global Innovation Barometer, spoke of greater
   boldness needed in aiding leaders at all levels to deal with expanding
   complexity in their roles. Comstock argues that [62]today’s employees
   need to be ‘disruption ready.’ Rather than merely accepting current
   business structures or processes, they need to push back and offer new
   options that change the playing field for their work. For example, one
   global real estate investment firm reached out to its staff to identify
   and solve a myriad of issues that were impacting the operational
   efficiency of the organization. The company proactively trained dozens
   of middle level managers in collaboration skills and provided
   permission and space for disruptive thinking. Rather than just plugging
   in existing task-based solutions these managers eagerly expanded the
   boundaries of their thought processes. With encouragement from senior
   leaders, middle managers began shaking off their ‘tasks-only’
   mentality, reaching across divisions and once-sacred silos to engage
   new resources. Fresh perspectives began to emerge. Incentivizing middle
   managers to generate new conversations yielded confidence to approach
   senior leadership with recommendations for disruptive change.

   We often think of change as either flowing from the top down or from
   the grass roots up. But according to James Davison Hunter,
   a [63]University of Virginia professor and Executive Director of the
   Institute for the Advanced Study of Culture, [64]success in engaging
   the middle of an organization is what truly activates change. By
   engaging the middle, leaders can harness lasting shifts in thinking and
   behavior. When change is championed from the top down and the center
   out, companies maximize their innovation momentum.

   Going forward, don’t just design your innovation strategies to engage
   senior leadership. Consider how the middle of your workforce can serve
   as a new, unsung resource for innovation and change.
