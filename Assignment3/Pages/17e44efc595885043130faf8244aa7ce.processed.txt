   Following his packed-out show last year, American television star and
   acclaimed comedian Aziz Ansari returns to London's Hammersmith Eventim
   Apollo on 30th November.
   Having spent the year touring the states, including two shows at New
   York's Madison Square Garden, Aziz brings his unique take on modern
   life to London for a one off comedy event. Named Rolling Stones
   Magazine's 'Funniest Man under 30', Aziz Ansari's critically acclaimed
   stand up special Buried Alive debuted late last year on Netflix,
   cementing his position as one of America's brightest young comedians
   and earning its way into a number of best stand up lists, including The
   Onion and AV Club.
   Ansari is best known for his starring role in Emmy and Golden Globe
   nominated sitcom Parks and Recreation, a critical favourite amongst
   both American and UK audiences which is about to enter its sixth
   season. With credits also stretching to film, having appeared in Funny
   People (Universal) and This is the End (20th Century Fox) opposite Seth
   Rogan and James Franco, Ansari's star continues to grow, having also
   lent his voice to animated features such as Epic and Ice Age:
   Continental Drift.
