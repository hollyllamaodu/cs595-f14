The Staggering Cost To Insure A Teenage Driver

   [46]Comment Now
   [47]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   It’s a day most parents endure with equal elements of relief and
   trepidation.

   Once a teenager finally obtains his or her driver’s license, mom and
   dad become refreshingly unshackled from the unrelenting cycle of drop
   offs and pick-ups, the latter of which tend to reach later into the
   evening hours the older one’s offspring become. This euphoria is, of
   course, tempered with the particular parental pattern of worry that’s
   an integral part of a freshly licensed driver’s vehicular forays into
   the unknown. Not to scare anyone in this situation, but car crashes
   remain the leading cause of death among Americans ages 15 to 19
   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

   And then there’s one component of this rite of passage that can be
   particularly egregious to a family’s budget, namely the ensuing and
   often astronomical jump in auto insurance premiums.

   Got one or more kids with learners’ permits in hand champing at the bit
   to finish their pre-license requirements in anticipation of a trip to
   the DMV? Are you sitting down? Adding a teen driver to a married
   couple’s auto insurance policy boosts rates by an average 79 percent
   according to a recent report conducted for the website
   InsuranceQuotes.com in San Francisco, CA.

   Of course, as is typically the case with car insurance, gender matters
   here. Insuring a 16-year-old son will increase the insurance bill by a
   whopping average 92 percent, while adding a same-age daughter will
   result in a somewhat softer 67 percent surcharge. And that’s cheap
   compared to what a teen driver might pay if he or she were to obtain
   car coverage separate from the family’s plan. Of course the downside is
   that you’ll share the burden (not that it would be the first time) of
   your kid’s mistakes; any ensuing traffic accidents will likely jack up
   the family’s insurance rates even further and – worse – could expose
   the primary policyholder to lawsuits resulting from personal and/or
   property damage beyond the covered limits.

   As if this is any consolation, the cost to insure a teen driver has
   actually dropped over the past year. In 2013, the average surcharge was
   85 percent, according to InsuranceQuotes.com, with a typical 98 percent
   boost for newly licensed males and 73 percent for females. One reason
   for the decrease could be attributed to the concurring drop in licensed
   teen drivers. A study conducted by the University of Michigan
   Transportation Institute suggests that only around 60 percent of those
   between the ages of 17 and 19 are licensed to drive, compared to 80
   percent of teens back in the 1980’s.

   As we’ve shown in the past, location matters when it comes to
   determining auto insurance rates and premiums for teenage drivers are
   no exception. Policyholders in New Hampshire will see their annual
   premiums leap by a staggering average 111 percent when a teenager
   driver is added to a family’s plan. At the other end of the spectrum,
   residents of Hawaii – a state that prohibits both age and sex as
   criteria for determining rates – will see their auto insurance bills
   rise by an average of just 17%.

   Here’s a breakdown of the 10 costliest states in the union for teenage
   drivers, based on their average premium increases:
    1. New Hampshire – 111%
    2. Rhode Island – 107%
    3. Maine – 107%
    4. Wyoming – 106%
    5. Connecticut – 102%
    6. Illinois – 101%
    7. Oregon – 101%
    8. Minnesota – 97%
    9. West Virginia – 93%
   10. Ohio – 93%

   On the brighter side, here’s a list of the 10 states in which families
   will enjoy the lowest average surcharges for adding a teen driver to
   their policies:
    1. Hawaii – 17%
    2. New York – 53%
    3. Michigan – 57%
    4. Montana – 61%
    5. New Mexico – 62%
    6. North Carolina – 65%
    7. South Dakota – 69%
    8. Mississippi – 73%
    9. Nevada – 74%
   10. Wisconsin – 74%

   Fortunately, insurance costs will gradually drop with each successive
   year a teen driver accumulates experience behind the wheel, provided of
   course he or she does not accrue any rate-busting moving violations or
   accidents in the meantime. According to InsuranceQuotes.com data, a
   teen driver’s premium surcharge will eventually fall to an average of
   58 percent once he or she turns 19.

   Also, there are a number of ways to help temper the financial sting of
   adding a young driver to the family policy. For starters, the usual
   panaceas apply, including shopping around for cheaper coverage,
   leveraging all available adult driver discounts and/or raising
   deductibles for collision and comprehensive coverage (but be sure to
   maintain a high threshold for liability to protect the family’s assets
   in case it’s needed). If you’re living in a crowded urban area,
   consider relocating the brood to a sleepy suburb where rates will
   inherently tend to be lower. Beyond that, insurance companies often
   give price breaks as high as 20 percent to kids who maintain good
   grades (a B average or better) and/or who take specified driver safety
   courses. Another way to help keep rates lower is to seek out a company
   that rewards safe driving habits – albeit intrusively – based on
   real-time assessments from an electronic monitor that plugs into a
   car’s onboard diagnostics port.

   Finally, if you’re buying a teen driver his or her own car, choose one
   that’s inherently less costly to insure. Avoid anything that’s even the
   least bit flashy or sporty – crossovers/SUVs and minivans tend to
   deliver the lowest overall premiums – and choose a model that both gets
   stellar crash-test ratings and is equipped with a modicum of safety
   features, including antilock brakes, stability control and
   front/side-impact airbags.

   The fine print: Rates for the above rankings were conducted by Quadrant
   Information Services based on rate calculations from the largest
   insurance carriers in each state. The averages are based on family
   coverage that includes a married and employed 45-year-old male and
   45-year-old female having clean driving records and good credit who
   each drive 12,000 miles per year with policy limits of $100,000 for
   injury liability for one person, $300,000 for all injuries and a $500
   deductible on collision and comprehensive coverage.
