Special Teams Miscues Factors Into Tough Loss

   Posted Sep 21, 2014

   [Czarda_Stephen.JPG] Stephen Czarda Associate Writer [47]@Redskins
     * [48]a
     * [49]a

In a hard fought game against the Eagles, the Redskins' special teams unit
had two timely mistakes that factored into the 37-34 decision.

   Two weeks after a blocked punt and blocked extra point factored into a
   bitter defeat, the Washington Redskins’ special teams performance once
   again were under the microscope Sunday in a tough fought 37-34 loss to
   the Philadelphia Eagles.

   The Redskins received the opening kickoff and punctuated a methodical
   11-play, 82-yard drive that chewed nearly seven minutes off the clock
   with fullback [50]Darrel Young [icon-article-link.gif] ’s third
   touchdown in as many games.

   While it zapped some of the energy out of the home crowd at Lincoln
   Financial Field, the Eagles struck back just one play later, as kick
   returner Chris Polk eluded tackle attempts by safety [51]Brandon
   Meriweather [icon-article-link.gif] and punter [52]Tress Way
   [icon-article-link.gif] for a 102-yard touchdown return, giving the
   momentum right back to the home team.

   After the game, head coach Jay Gruden admitted it was frustrating to
   see the Eagles take the kick back for a touchdown just moments after
   the offense constructed such a strong drive.

   “It’s a good football team we played and they’re going to make their
   plays,” Gruden said. “But we all have our hand in this. Coaching also
   was defeated.

   “So I’m not going to point my finger at special teams. Everybody had
   their hand [in this], but we do have to figure out a way to cover kicks
   better.”

   Young echoed his head coach’s thoughts, saying that they found a hole
   in the Redskins’ coverage and attacked it.

   “That was pretty rough having a kickoff return for a touchdown,” Young
   said. “I thought we were getting better, but we had some success.
   Credit to them, they did a really good job scheming us.

   “We just have to go back to the drawing board and do some things
   different, [and] find out what makes us successful.”

   Also having a hand in the special team unit’s struggles was a missed
   33-yard field goal by kicker [53]Kai Forbath [icon-article-link.gif] .

   After forcing the Eagles into a three-and-out on their first drive of
   the fourth quarter in a game that was tied, the Redskins got the ball
   on their own 45-yard line before driving deep into Eagles territory.

   The drive would stall out on the Eagles’ 14-yard line, as Forbath – who
   had successful converted on a career-high 18 straight field goal
   attempt– came out onto the field with the chance to put the Redskins up
   by three.

   His kick, however, knocked off the right upright.

   “It’s a 33 yarder, there’s no excuse [for missing],” Forbath said after
   the game. “That’s on me. We got a short week.

   “We’ll come back. I thought I would have another chance to help the
   team out, unfortunately I didn’t, so it’s on to the next one.”
