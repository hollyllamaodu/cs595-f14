The Bendable iPhone 6 Plus May Be Too Thin For Its Own Good

   [51]Comment Now
   [52]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Fear not! The iPhone 6 (regular edition) does not appear to bend
   appreciably. Sorry #bentgate enthusiasts. See update video at bottom of
   post.

   IFRAME: [53]http://www.youtube.com/embed/znK652H6yQM

   The iPhone 6 Plus is by all accounts a beautiful piece of technology.
   It is large but delicately thin with smooth curves of machined
   aluminum. It is a pleasure to hold—but reports indicate it may not hold
   its shape.

   Lewis Hilsenteger of [54]Unbox Therapy made a video today to
   investigate complaints that some brand new iPhone 6 units got bent in
   people’s pockets (see video above and stills below.) So far, a few
   photos of bent phones have popped up under the hashtag #[55]bentgate.
   All of this just happened since Friday and there is no evidence of a
   “coverup” on [56]Apple's [57]Apple's part, so there is no actual
   “gate.” And, as Derek Kessler writes on [58]iMore, the iPhone 5 and 5S
   are also made out of aluminum and can also be bent: ”A phone that’s
   made out of a generally rigid but deceptively thin metal shell can be
   permanently deformed if too much force is applied.” He even claims to
   own an iPhone 5 “with a slight bend to it,” himself.

   bendable-iphone-6-plus-unbox-therapy-1

   So if there is no “gate” and this isn’t a new phenomenon, why the fuss?
   First, even for Apple fans like Hilsenteger it’s always fun to have
   something to criticize. Second, Apple watchers are always on the
   lookout for the company over reaching. Year after year it significantly
   improves its products and sets sales records. Surely the s-curve fill
   flatten at some point?

   Other than envy or sour grapes, there is something at stake here very
   close to Apple’s soul. User experience is largely about avoiding
   unexpected behavior. When we say that Apple’s products are intuitive we
   mean that they do what we think they will do even if we are using them
   for the first time. By moving into Samsung’s phablet territory Apple is
   sending the implicit message to its customers that its version will
   provide a superior user experience.

   The thinness, the lightness, the smooth edges and the metal build are
   all supposed to serve to delight the user. But since it is an iPhone,
   albeit a large one, users that are used to putting their phone in their
   pocket will continue to do so as long as the pocket is large enough.
   (This is no mean feat for the 6 Plus!) So the fact that a routine trip
   to the back pocket could lead to a permanently bent (and possibly
   unusable) iPhone should be uncomfortable for Apple.

   bendable-iphone-6-plus-unbox-therapy-2

   Hilsenteger applied the full force of his thumbs to his brand-new
   iPhone 6 Plus and the image above is the result. What is not shown in
   this video is what happened when he tried to straighten the aluminum
   back out. The previously flexible screen cracked. See the image he
   posted on Instagram below for the sad sight.

   cracked-iphone-6-plus-unbox-therapy-3

   The hard-earned lessons for iPhone 6  and 6 Plus users are clearly:
    1. Do not keep your new iPhone in any pocket that is remotely tight,
       and
    2. If your phone does bend DO NOT try to bend it back!

   The takeaway for Apple is trickier. Phil Schiller seemed to take great
   pride in announcing that the 6 Plus is just .2 mm thicker than the 6.
   But given the fact that the 6 Plus has a third more surface area than
   the 6, that measly extra 3% of thickness should have been a clue that
   it could have significant structural weaknesses. Indeed, Hilsenteger
   describes how he applied the force to the center of the phone but the
   bend occurred up near the button cutouts.

   LG-bentgate-640

   A snarky tweet from LG in Germany (above) chided Apple about #bentgate
   that, ”It wouldn’t have happened with the LG G Flex.” The point is
   well-taken and I would look for Apple to explore more flexible
   materials for the next generation of the 6 Plus. Nickel titanium, the
   material that flexible eyeglass frames are made out of, makes it clear
   that a metal can be both strong and super-flexible. It is also 5-10
   times the cost of aluminum. It is also heavier. When I
   asked Hilsenteger if the 6 Plus should have been made out of titanium
   instead of aluminum he immediately replied “space grade!”

   unbendable-samsung-note-3-unbox-therapy Bonus Round: The unbendable
   Samsung Note 3!

   Not one to let a bent iPhone get him down, Hilsenteger tried to see if
   you could similarly destroy a Samsung Note 3. Although unlovely in
   comparison to the iPhone 6 Plus, the Note 3 could not be bent! Maybe
   slightly warped, but definitely not bent. The moral of the story (for
   now) is that if you want to keep your phablet in your pants pocket—get
   a Samsung! If you want an oversized iPhone, keep it in your purse or
   shirt pocket.

       And that’s exactly what you would expect to happen! I would venture
       to guess that iPhone users expect to have to worry about cracking
       the screen, but not bending the metal casing…

       seems apple clearly has a situation with this, but for those who
       have bought their iPhones, I see a way around the problem that’s an
       easy fix. I always have my cell in a pocket that’s not in my
       clothes, but over or under them. which seems odd when I say it that
       way, but it’s really not. I use PortaPocket which is a system that
       lets you hands-free carry what you need, and wear it ON your body.
       It’s simply a different (and useful) way of doing things, and
       prevents any of these bending situations. Maybe one day it will be
       appreciated for the problem-solver that it is. It works.

       I’m an Apple fan and I actually like the fact that this is
       happening. There needs to be a point at which these phones stop
       getting thinner. I understand that they didn’t want a weight shock
       in regards to increasing in size, but were already thin and super
       light as it was anyway…and in addition to durability a thicker
       phone will have the added benefit of a thicker, hence longer
       lasting, battery.

       to be fair, the issue isn’t that the phone is thinner. the issue is
       that the phone has a design flaw that results in this. the Galaxy
       Note 3 is not that much thicker than the 6+, yet if you watched the
       comparison is MUCH MUCH stronger.
       and we have already seen BIGGER phones i.e. HTC One Max and LG G
       Flex that are bigger and just as thin and don’t suffer from the
       same problem.
       in fact the HTC One Max has practically the same design as the 6+
       (though admittedly thicker).
       the plain and simple issue here is that Apple got into a market
       that it does not know, it designed a device that it has no
       experience with. and there are a LOT of significant design flaws
       that show that fact.
       It’s not about phones not getting thinner, because they will get
       thinner. in fact Samsung is working on a phone that is literally
       foldable!
       The issue is calling out apple for bad design. the way they did
       things in past won’t cut it here, that is why it took Samsung a
       while to perfect the phablet market. It’s not the biggest deal in
       the world, Apple isn’t the industry leader in this class. It’s
       their first go, call them out for their failures and missteps, and
       wait until they get it right. This is not it

       Agree. I was an Apple stockholder for past 4 years & expected
       15-20% increase to 115-125, but had to get out after seeing video.
       Working in the mechanical engineering field it appears to be a
       design flaw. 2nd video has been released in public forum with
       witnesses & the iphone 6 plus failed worse than the 1st with what
       appeared far less force. I’m not short or long the stock currently
       & will sit on the sideline for now. 2 things I find disturbing from
       Consumer Reports testing. First, that it shows only 70 lbs of
       pressure to bend the iphone6 whereas the 5s required 130 lbs of
       pressure to bend it! Only 54% as strong as previous model. Second
       issue is that CR shows the 6 weaker than the 6 Plus, but the real
       life videos show vice versa. CR needs to retest with a more dynamic
       testing procedure moving the load location closer to the upper 1/3
       of the length of the phone using multiple phones in order to get a
       larger control group. To me this all suggests an acute design flaw
       in the 6+ (early life failures) & a possible chronic case weakness
       in the 6 (mid to late life failures). I originally thought the
       weakness was limited to the 6+, but now fear from CR data that the
       6 may also be susceptible later in the life cycle. The big question
       will be how does Apple handle it from here? My prediction is they
       frantically buy all 6+ and/or remove from inventory quietly & fix
       the problem while PR says sorry due to unexpected demand we have a
       5-7 week delay in supplying. The 6 they will have to gamble that
       since it has a smaller footprint & later life cycle failure & do
       nothing with current supplies while implementing a tougher case
       preferably before selling to China. Either way a big disappointment
       from what is a very good phone otherwise. Wish they could have
       limited the bugs to just software as hardware bugs are much more
       expensive to fix.

       LOL! This is the fifth and I’m sure there’ll be more. The phone is
       thinner…if you put it in a tight pocket, it’s going to bend. It’s
       metal – metal bends. To keep that from happening, put it in a
       looser pocket or put a case around it. Anyone walking around with
       any smartphone without a case is playing Russian roulette with
       their investment.

       To be 100% fair here, this shouldn’t be much of a story.
       Admittedly, I am not an apple fan. I never really have been, but
       despite that I can see that apple is being unfairly judged here.
       apple has NEVER made a phone over 5” up to this point, they have
       NEVER made a phone this thin before.
       they are attempting to get into a market that is literally
       inundated by other companies who have been doing it for YEARS,
       learning from mistakes, and improving it. Was the original Galaxy
       Note the pinnacle of all things phablet? of course not. It was the
       first shot at it.
       How can you compare apple, who has no experience in this class of
       phone, to LG, HTC or least of all Samsung. who have had 5 or more
       years of not just trial and error, but feedback and adjustments.
       I think people get caught up in this fable that apple products are
       great, just because they are apple products. once upon a time, that
       may have been true. but this is a new realm for apple, and it’s not
       fair to hold them to the gold standards of that class when they are
       the new kid on the block.
       they will get better, i imagine. but they have a long way to go to
       really standout as a functional, practical phablet. their loyal
       devotees will buy it no matter what, so that will buy them some
       time.
       but they deserve time to make the adjustments just like any other
       company trying something new. they are not the pinnacle of all
       things tech anymore, they aren’t infallible, they are just a tech
       company.
       maybe it’s time to start treating them like one, instead of like an
       evil empire or jesus christ come to earth in tech form.
       just a thought

       While what you say is true, their growing pains will cost them &
       their stock price will suffer in the interim. It could also be
       argued that their reputation will take a hit causing increased
       pressure on profit margins & difficulty in ability to price
       products at their usual premiums.

       Ummm… Don’t bend your phone. This is terrible reporting. Every
       phone can be bent. I’ve seen videos of Notes, LGs, etc being bent.
       This guy was bending so hard his hands were shaking. There are less
       than a dozen reports out of ten million. How does this qualify as
       news??? Or of that tiny fraction, how many were independently
       verified? I’m seeing a trend where Apple gets held to some
       ridiculous standard. If three guys out of millions have a problem,
       the trolls in the media lend them a giant microphone. But when
       there are almost 500 known security flaws in the current version of
       Android, when the Nexus 7 had major issues, nobody reported them.
       Why?

       I almost can’t believe this – this is like a confirmation of my
       worst fears when it comes to thinner “better” technology – I’m
       happy to see that there’s so much fire coming back from the early
       adopters in telling Apple that longer battery life and a thicker
       phone is what we need – not a thinner phone as more of a “gimmick”
       to prove that they can – rather than taking into consideration the
       everyday wear of such a product.

       So as we can see , apple opted for form over function. But over the
       coming days we will see and hear fans, leaping to apples defense.
       Many of them will claim large phones should not go in pockets, or
       make statements pretending the users are at fault. meanwhile
       outside the apple world millions of users have had large phones
       that don’t bend and crack and they have had them for a long time…
       maybe apple should not have made it so long and skinny, and just
       copied Sammy more closely….

       I’m not really concerned about this. Common sense says that these
       boxes filled with sensitive electronics are in no way
       indestructible. As the length to thickness ratio increases with any
       geometric shape, it becomes easier to bend regardless of what the
       phone is. I don’t believe that the iPhone has ever been touted as
       being a rugged device.

       Bottom line is the phone is too thin for it’s own good. I don’t
       understand why everyone is fawning all over these phones when (a)
       they are uncomfortable to hold, (b) slippery to the touch and (c)
       way too light. And aluminum? Forgive me but that is just bad
       design. Sorry, Apple.

       What a load of baloney this is. This guy with the video in no way
       was stimulated by “reports of iphone 6′s bending. There are so few.
       The video he posted is edited to appear what it is no; the forces
       involved were not scientific in any way and the sequence of the
       shots where not even chronological. Purely a scam so this guy can
       make money, prolonged by this and similarly idiotic reporting from
       your magazine – likewise to get clicks and revenue. Now why would a
       larger structure that is thinner bend with less but large force
       than a smaller model. if the writer does not know then go to
       engineering school or READ about it.
