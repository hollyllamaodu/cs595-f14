   Climate Change
   And President Obama's Action Plan
     __________________________________________________________________

   In 2013, President Obama announced a series of executive actions to
   reduce carbon pollution, prepare the U.S. for the impacts of climate
   change, and lead international efforts to address global climate
   change.

   At the United Nations on September 23, President Obama participated in
   the Climate Summit — a meeting of world leaders to showcase climate
   action commitments from governments, local leaders, and the private
   sector.

   The President gave a speech at the summit that highlighted the
   ambitious actions the U.S. is taking under his Climate Action Plan,
   while stressing that all major economies must step up to the plate if
   we are to avoid the dangerous consequences of climate change.

   Watch the President's speech below -- and [161]learn more about the new
   actions we're taking to strengthen global resilience to climate change
   and cut carbon pollution.

   We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe
   drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen
   were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the
   overwhelming judgment of science — and act before it's too late."

Carbon Pollution

   We're still contributing to the problem

Carbon pollution is the biggest
driver of climate change
     __________________________________________________________________

Global temperatures and carbon dioxide levels are on the rise

   The global annual average temperature has increased by more than 1.5
   degrees F between 1880 and 2012. This interactive graph from the
   National Climate Assessment shows the concentration of atmospheric
   carbon dioxide over the same time period. Climate scientists say we
   need to avert an additional 2-degree temperature increase to avoid the
   most catastrophic impacts of climate change.

   IFRAME: [167]http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/embed/16678
     __________________________________________________________________

U.S. greenhouse gas pollution includes:

   [carbonDioxide.png]

Carbon Dioxide (CO2), 82%

   [climate_greenhouse_gas_emissions_3.png]

   Enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas,
   and oil), solid waste, trees and wood products, and also as a result of
   certain chemical reactions (e.g., manufacture of cement).
   [floruinatedGasses.png]

Fluorinated gases, 3%

   Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride are
   synthetic, powerful greenhouse gases that are emitted from a variety of
   industrial processes.

Nitrous Oxide (N2O), 6%

   Emitted during agricultural and industrial activities, as well as
   during combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste.
   [methane.png]

Methane (CH4), 9%

   Emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and
   oil as well as from landfills.

We've made progress thanks to:

Stronger Fuel Economy Standards

   We set the highest fuel [168]economy standards in American history that
   will double the efficiency of our cars and trucks by 2025.

INCREASING CLEAN ENERGY

   Since President Obama took office, the U.S. [169]increased solar
   generation by more than ten-fold and tripled electricity production
   from wind power.

Decreased Carbon Pollution

   In 2012, U.S. greenhouse gas pollution fell to the lowest level in
   nearly 20 years.

Renewable Energy and Efficiency Targets

   35 states have [170]renewable energy targets in place, and more than 25
   have set energy efficiency targets.

President Obama's Plan to Cut Carbon Pollution

The President's Plan to Cut Carbon Pollution in America

Reducing Carbon Pollution from Power Plants

   [climate_power_plants.png]

   Power plants are the largest major source of emissions in the U.S.,
   together accounting for roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse
   gas pollution.

PROGRESS:

   In September 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced
   proposed [171]carbon pollution standards for new power plants.

PROGRESS:

   The EPA has met with more than 300 stakeholder groups from across the
   country to gather information on standards for existing power plants.
   In June 2014, the EPA issued proposed[172] carbon pollution standards
   for existing power plants.
     __________________________________________________________________

Continuing the momentum for the future:

   The EPA is on track to finalize guidelines for existing power plants by
   2015.

   On June 2, the EPA [173]released a proposal that will set the
   first-ever national carbon pollution standards limits for America’s
   existing power plants.

Accelerating Clean Energy Leadership

   [climate_clean_energy_leadership.png]

   During the President's first term, the United States more than doubled
   generation of electricity from wind and solar energy.
     __________________________________________________________________


PROGRESS:

   Since President Obama took office, the U.S. increased solar generation
   by more than ten-fold and tripled electricity production from wind
   power.

PROGRESS:

   The Department of the Interior (DOI) announced permitting the [175]50th
   utility-scale renewable energy project on public lands. The projects
   could support more than 20,000 jobs and generate enough electricity to
   power 4.8 million homes.

PROGRESS:

   In May 2014, the DOE’s Solar Instructor Training Network announced it
   will support training programs at community colleges across the country
   that will assist 50,000 workers to enter the solar industry by 2020.

PROGRESS:

   In May 2014, President Obama announced more than 300 commitments
   private and public sector commitments to create jobs and cut carbon
   pollution by advancing solar deployment and energy efficiency —
   representing enough energy to power nearly 130,000 homes.
     __________________________________________________________________

Continuing the momentum for the future:

   To ensure America's continued leadership position in clean energy,
   President Obama has set new goals.

2015

   President Obama's Fiscal Year 2015 Budget continues to further American
   leadership by investing approximately $6.9 billion in funding for clean
   energy technology programs. This includes investment in a range of
   energy technologies, from advanced biofuels and emerging nuclear
   technologies to clean coal.

2020

   To ensure America's continued leadership position in clean energy.
   President Obama has set a goal to double wind and solar electricity
   generation once again by 2020.

2020

   Federal agencies are setting a new goal of reaching 100MW of installed
   renewable capacity across federally-subsidized housing stock by 2020.

2025

   The Department of Defense — the single largest consumer of energy in
   the United States — is committed to deploying three gigawatts of
   renewable energy on military installations by 2025.

Building a 21st Century Clean Energy Infrastructure

   [climate_transportation_sector.png]

   Heavy-duty vehicles (commercial trucks, vans, and buses) are currently
   the second largest source of greenhouse gas pollution within the
   transportation sector.
     __________________________________________________________________


PROGRESS:

   In January 2014, President Obama signed a [176]Presidential Memorandum
   establishing the federal government’s first Quadrennial Energy Review
   (QER) process, with an initial focus on our nation's energy
   infrastructure.

PROGRESS:

   In February 2014, President Obama directed EPA and DOT to develop and
   issue the next phase of [177]heavy-duty vehicle fuel efficiency and
   greenhouse gas standards by March 2016.

PROGRESS:

   In 2011, the Administration finalized fuel economy standards for Model
   Year 2014-2018 for heavy-duty trucks, buses, and vans. This will reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions by about 270 million metric tons and save 530
   million barrels of oil.

PROGRESS:

   The Administration has already established the toughest fuel economy
   standards for passenger vehicles in U.S. history. These standards
   require an average performance equivalent of 54.5 miles per gallon by
   2025.
     __________________________________________________________________

Continuing the momentum for the future:

   During the President's second term, the Administration is partnering
   with industry leaders and other key stakeholders.

Post-2018

   In partnership with industry leaders and other key stakeholders, the
   Administration will develop post-2018 fuel economy standards for
   heavy-duty vehicles to further reduce consumption through the
   application of advanced cost-effective technologies.



   The Administration will also support the Renewable Fuel Standard and
   invest in research and development to help bring next-generation
   biofuels on line.

Cutting energy waste in homes, businesses, and factories

   [climate_cutting_energy_waste.png]

   Energy efficiency is one of the clearest and most cost-effective
   opportunities to save families money, make our businesses more
   competitive, and reduce greenhouse gas pollution.
     __________________________________________________________________


PROGRESS:

   Since June, 75 new partners have joined the President’s [178]Better
   Buildings Challenge. More than 190 organizations, together representing
   over 3 billion square feet of building space, have now committed to
   energy savings.

PROGRESS:

   In President Obama's first term, DOE and HUD completed efficiency
   upgrades in nearly two million homes, saving many families more than
   $400 on their heating and cooling bills in the first year alone.

PROGRESS:

   In December 2013, the Department of Agriculture announced it will
   provide up to $250 million to help businesses and residential customers
   in rural areas [179]cut their energy bills through energy efficiency
   and renewable energy use.

PROGRESS:

   Since June, DOE has issued nine proposed and seven final energy
   conservation standards for appliances and equipment. If finalized and
   combined with rules already issued, the energy savings will help cut
   consumers' electricity bills by hundreds of billions of dollars.
     __________________________________________________________________

Continuing the momentum for the future:

   The Administration will continue to take a range of new steps geared
   toward achieving President Obama's goal of doubling energy productivity
   by 2030, relative to 2010 levels.

2020

   In 2011, President Obama announced the Better Buildings Initiative to
   help commercial and industrial buildings become at least 20 percent
   more energy efficient by 2020. To continue the success, the
   Administration will expand the Challenge to multifamily housing to cut
   energy waste.
   In addition, the Administration is launching the Better Buildings
   Accelerators, to support and encourage adoption of state and local
   policies to cut energy waste.

2030

   The Administration will build on this momentum by establishing new
   efficiency standards that — when combined with the progress already
   underway from the first term — will reduce carbon pollution by at least
   3 billion metric tons by 2030, equivalent to more than a year's carbon
   pollution from our entire electricity system.

Reducing other greenhouse gas emissions

   [climate_greenhouse_gas.png]

   Emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) — which are potent greehouse
   gases — are expected to double by 2020 and nearly triple by 2030 in the
   U.S.

PROGRESS:

   Since 1990, methane emissions have decreased by 11% in part through
   partnerships with industry.

PROGRESS:

   In March 2014, the Administration released a [180]Strategy to Reduce
   Methane Emissions from landfills, coal mining, agriculture, and oil and
   gas systems through voluntary actions and common-sense standards.
     __________________________________________________________________

Continuing the momentum for the future:

   The United States must lead through international diplomacy and
   domestic actions to reduce emissions and transition to safer and more
   substantial options.

2020

   The Environmental Protection Agency and the Departments of Agriculture,
   Energy, Interior, Labor, and Transportation will implement a
   comprehensive, interagency methane strategy.
   The EPA will also use its authority under the Clean Air Act to
   encourage private sector investment in low-emissions technology by
   identifying and approving climate-friendly chemicals while prohibiting
   certain uses of more harmful HFCs.

Moving Forward

   When it comes to the oil and gas sector, investments to build and
   upgrade gas pipelines will not only put more Americans to work, but
   also reduce emissions and enhance economic productivity.
   The Obama Administration will work collaboratively with state
   governments, as well as the private sector, to reduce emissions across
   multiple sectors, improve air quality, and achieve public health and
   economic benefits.

   Since 2008, federal agencies have reduced greenhouse gas pollution by
   more than 17 percent — the equivalent of permanently taking 1.8 million
   cars off the road.

PROGRESS:

   Expanded energy performance contracts from $2 billion to $4 billion to
   provide energy efficiency upgrades for Federal buildings, at no net
   cost to the taxpayer.

PROGRESS:

   On December 5, President Obama signed a [181]Presidential Memorandum
   directing the federal government to buy at least 20% of its electricity
   from renewable sources by 2020.
     __________________________________________________________________

Continuing the momentum for the future:

   President Obama believes that the federal government must be a leader
   in clean energy and energy efficiency.

2020

   The federal government will consume 20 percent of its electricity from
   renewable sources by 2020 — more than double the current goal of 7.5
   percent.



   The President committed to reduce the federal government’s direct
   greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent below 2008 levels by 2020.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Even as we take new steps to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, we
   must also prepare for the impacts of a changing climate that are
   already being felt across the country.

   [climate_grey_quote.jpg]

   …Science, accumulated and reviewed over decades, tells us that our
   planet is changing in ways that will have profound impacts on all of
   humankind…those who are already feeling the effects of climate change
   don’t have time to deny it—they’re busy dealing with it.”
   - President Obama, 2013
   [184]Read the Press Release
     __________________________________________________________________

   Moving forward, the Obama Administration will help states, cities, and
   towns build stronger communities and infrastructure, protect critical
   sectors of our economy as well as our natural resources, and use sound
   science to better understand and manage climate impacts.

   strengthen communities against future extreme weather and other climate
   impacts and update flood risk reduction standards for all federally
   funded projects.

PROGRESS:

   From HUD grants and DOT funding for resilient transit systems to a DOI
   competition for support for coastal resilience projects, over $10B in
   Sandy recovery funds is being used to increase resilience.

PROGRESS:

   On August 19, the Hurricane Sandy Task Force [187]delivered a
   rebuilding strategy that is serving as a model for communities across
   the nation.
