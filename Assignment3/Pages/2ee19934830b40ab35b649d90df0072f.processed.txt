   Since Forbes hired me in 1995 to write a legal column, I’ve taken
   advantage of the great freedom the magazine grants its staff, to pursue
   stories about everything from books to billionaires. I’ve chased South
   Africa’s first black billionaire through a Cape Town shopping mall
   while admirers flocked around him, climbed inside the hidden chamber in
   the home of an antiquarian arms and armor dealer atop San Francisco’s
   Telegraph Hill, and sipped Chateau Latour with one of Picasso’s
   grandsons in the Venice art museum of French tycoon François Pinault.
   I’ve edited the magazine’s Lifestyle section and opinion pieces by the
   likes of John Bogle and Gordon Bethune. As deputy leadership editor,
   these days I mostly write about careers and corporate social
   responsibility. I got my job at Forbes through a brilliant libertarian
   economist, Susan Lee, whom I used to put on television at
   MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour. Before that I covered law and lawyers for
   journalistic stickler, harsh taskmaster and the best teacher a young
   reporter could have had, Steven Brill.

The Shortest Route To A New Job

   [46]The Shortest Route To A New Job

   In his editor’s introduction to the Forbes 400 issue a few years ago,
   chief product officer Lewis D’Vorkin recounted how he first came to
   work here. “I grabbed an orange grease pencil and vigorously marked up
   three issues, boldly suggesting ways to make a storied media brand even
   better,” he wrote. “I then mailed my handiwork to Jim.” Lewis was
   referring to Jim Michaels, the late, legendary editor of the magazine.
   Soon after, Jim brought Lewis in for a chat. It took some time, but 10
   years later Lewis’s phone rang. It was Jim Michaels, offering him a
   job.

   Lewis’ is a classic story of direct contact leading to a great job. He
   didn’t find the position through an ad or even through networking.
   Instead, he knew where he wanted to work, he figured out who was in
   charge, and he reached out to that person directly, making a compelling
   case with his orange grease pencil for why he’d be an asset.

   Every day, people get jobs this way. Three close friends of mine had
   similar experiences. One woman, who had been out of work for more than
   five years, was sitting on a volunteer task force where she met a woman
   she thought was a dynamo. My friend initiated a series of lunches with
   the woman, who headed an international non-profit. One day the
   non-profit director mentioned that she was looking for an
   administrative assistant. My friend would up convincing her that the
   position could be expanded to a more senior role with greater
   responsibility. She got the job. Another friend was tapping a contact
   for freelance work and discovered the contact was hiring for a
   full-time project manager position at a large consulting firm. My
   friend landed the job. Likewise my third friend was talking to an
   organization about putting in some time as a consultant. The
   organization liked him so much, it asked him to come on board as a
   partner.

   According to Kate Wendleton, founder and president of the Five O’Clock
   Club, the national job coaching firm, too few job seekers use this
   method. “The first thing people do is answer ads on the Internet,” she
   says. “That’s probably the least effective thing you can do.” Fewer
   than 10% of job seekers find work that way, she says.

   Many of us got our first jobs using direct contact. Perhaps you went
   from shop to shop in the mall and asked each manager for work as a
   clerk. Or you approached all the dining establishments in your
   community for a job as a busboy or waitress. The method still works as
   your career advances.

   Wendleton says people often confuse direct contact with networking.
   Networking is an effective way to find work, she says, but it can be
   roundabout. A friend of a friend may work in production at the company
   where you want to work in marketing. By all means take that person to
   lunch. If he or she can put in a good word for you with your would-be
   boss, great. But don’t let that prevent you from going straight to the
   person you’d like to report to.
   [47]The Forbes eBook: Find And Keep Your Dream Job
   [48]The Definitive Careers Guide From Forbes encompasses every aspect
   of the job hunt, from interview to promotion. Written by some of
   Forbes’ best careers and leadership writers, it is available now for
   download.

   To start a direct contact action plan, Wendleton says, you should make
   a list of companies where you would want to work, figure out who heads
   the division you want to target at each, and get in touch. The Five
   O’Clock Club recommends you put an exhaustive 50 to 60 companies on
   your list, in three groups, A, B and C. The C list is made up of
   companies that would want you though you might not want them. The A
   list is where you most want to work. Wendleton recommends starting with
   the C list first, and then moving to the B list. By the time you get to
   the A list, you should have several job offers, so you can say to the A
   companies, I have four offers, but I really want to work for you.

   Target each letter to the specific company, and ideally to the person
   you’re contacting. “You could say, ‘I see that international sales have
   dropped in many companies in your industry,’” Wendleton suggests.
   “‘I’ve got 10 years of international marketing experience in your
   industry, and I’ve been able to increase sales in every organization
   I’ve worked for.’” Wendleton calls that your “grabber” opener. Then you
   should include bullet points outlining concrete achievements you’ve
   made. For instance, when you worked at the Gap, you increased sales in
   the U.K. by 35% over a period of two years, from 2002 to 2004.

   For your C list companies, Wendleton says, you can be a little less
   aggressive than with the A list. Close your C list letters by saying, I
   can only imagine how busy you must be, so I won’t follow up with a
   phone call. However, if you’re interested in meeting, please give me a
   call. Attach your résumé. In your A list letters, close by saying, I’ll
   call you in the next few days. Wendleton recommends sending duplicate
   letters via e-mail and snail mail. You can acknowledge in the e-mail
   that you’re also sending a hard copy in an envelope.

   Wendleton has lots of advice for those phone calls to the A list.
   First, she suggests getting acquainted with your contact’s assistant
   before you send your letter and e-mail. Treat the assistant with
   respect. Introduce yourself, explain why you’re calling, and tell her
   to look out for your letter, if she wouldn’t mind. You can even give
   the assistant a mini-job pitch on the phone: I’ve got 10 years of
   international marketing experience, and I think I can help your company
   with its challenge. Then you can ask, politely but persistently, if she
   wouldn’t mind keeping an eye out for your letter. Include a sticky note
   addressed to the assistant, so that when she opens the boss’s mail,
   you’re addressing her directly.

   Leave only one phone message for the contact, Wendleton advises. Do
   follow up with more calls to the assistant, but don’t leave more
   messages; each time just tell her you’ll call back later, and ask if
   she knows when a good time would be. Try phoning early, before the
   assistant arrives, or late in the day. Prepare yourself to make at
   least 15 calls before you get through to the boss, Wendleton says.

   Your goal in the direct contact method is to meet the person who would
   have the power to hire you and to convince that person that you would
   be an asset to his or her team. In her own office, Wendleton met a job
   seeker she thought was a “dynamo.” She was looking to fill a low-level
   job for an assistant who would set up sales call appointments, but
   because she was so impressed with the dynamo, she created a new job for
   him as head of marketing. “We had to readjust our thinking around him,”
   she says.

   This is an update of a story that ran previously.
