Four Career Mistakes You Should Be Making -- And The One You Shouldn't

   [48]Comment Now
   [49]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   “We create as much information every two days as we have since the dawn
   of civilization through the year 2003.” – Don Peppers (Peppers & Rogers
   Group)

   Consider that statistic. That statistic was posted near the end of last
   year.

   Enormous amounts of information is generated every single second. There
   are more blogs, more news stories, more articles, more Tweets, more
   videos, books, and the list goes on. Instantly, any one of us can find
   a “How-To, Where-To, and What-To,” on any given subject. And most of
   the information is up to date—almost in real-time.  Every day you can
   find new insights, ponderings, advice, ratings, rankings, and comments.
   But how do you filter and leverage it so it actually benefits you and
   your career or business?

   The two of us have spent most of our careers focused on figuring out
   what actions and activities improve business, relationships,
   innovation, and outcomes. And, although we’ve had the opportunity to
   curiously examine data collected in some of the largest workplace
   studies ever, like the [50]Great Work Study, which analyzed 1.7 million
   cases of award-winning work, there was something else that caught our
   attention that we hadn’t taken a closer look at—mistakes.

   In a recent [51]Forbes Interview, former CEO of Cold Stone Creamery,
   Sheldon Harris shared with us one of his mistakes early in his career
   that forever changed the way he leads people. He formally reprimanded
   an employee for repeatedly coming in late, only to discover that he had
   been voluntarily cleaning up trash in the parking lot every morning
   before coming inside. It’s a classic tale of “foot in mouth” syndrome.

   Or, consider what it feels like to watch $125 million literally
   disintegrate. This is exactly what happened when some NASA scientists
   made miscalculations due to the use of English units instead of metric
   units on the [52]Mars [53]Mars Climate Orbiter. The spacecraft
   disintegrated as it passed through the upper atmosphere.
   [54]The Forbes eBook: Find And Keep Your Dream Job
   [55]The Definitive Careers Guide From Forbes encompasses every aspect
   of the job hunt, from interview to promotion. Written by some of
   Forbes’ best careers and leadership writers, it is available now for
   download.

   But, not all mistakes are so cut and dry. On a recent phone call, media
   and real estate mogul (and former Celebrity Apprentice Star) [56]Nely
   Galan shared with us a story about her teenage years where everyone
   thought she was making a mistake. It involved a headstrong battle with
   the Nuns who ran her Catholic School. However, the incident served as a
   major stepping-stone for who Nely has become today. Nely shared the
   story on [57]The Big Idea with Donny Deutsh.

   Consider these ‘mistakes’ for a second. They made us pause. And, they
   made us curious to find out how certain mistakes can actually be more
   valuable teachers than successes. Are there some mistakes you should
   make and some you shouldn’t?

   Looking to find answers to the question, ‘What are the valuable
   mistakes everyone should make in their career?’ we asked people we
   knew: “What mistakes have you made in your career that benefitted you
   in the long term?” and “What mistakes have you made in your career that
   hurt you in the long term?”

   The answers we received about mistakes that benefitted respondents fell
   into the following four categories.

   1. Say “Yes” to everything. It’s a common mistake, especially early in
   a career.  Saying ‘Yes’ can stretch a person or team thin. It can lead
   you into unchartered territories and, it can actually lead you to
   failure. Nevertheless, many of the people we talked to said they
   learned a lot from saying ‘yes’. One respondent said they learned ‘how
   to draw a line in the sand, and where to draw it.’ But, the answer that
   gave us the biggest ah-ha was from Dr. Murthy Renduchintala,
   Co-President of QCT at [58]Qualcomm [59]Qualcomm in San Diego,
   California. “This company started with seven people. The founders had a
   simple vision to improve communications—and that meant saying ‘Yes’ to
   possibility. We were the company that, no matter what the problem, or
   the deadline, or the situation, would find a solution.”

   2. Work for the jerk. Bad bosses are great filters for showing us both
   where we don’t want to work, and how we don’t want to treat people. As
   one respondent named Christa noted, ‘It seemed like a mistake at the
   time to accept the position because I had heard the manager was
   horrible. But, I really wanted to gain the experience. And, I learned a
   lot more about myself than I ever expected.’

   3. Get fired for what you believe. Not all of us will get tested in
   this area. This advice came from an employee who refused to read a
   specific script to some vendors because the employee felt the script
   was misleading and ethically irresponsible. That employee was let go.
   And, they were happy to leave.

   4. Assume you’re always right.  Of course we all want to appear to our
   coworkers and customers that we know everything about our company,
   service, or product. But, the truth is, none of us know it all and more
   than a few of the people we spoke to, told us how valuable it was to
   have their ego crushed. Why is this a great mistake to make? Because,
   once you know you can be wrong, you approach work differently knowing
   that your next decision might not be correct, but it will be a learning
   experience that leads you closer and closer to finding the most
   successful result.
    The fifth mistake: the one you don’t want to make.

    It was difficult for us to create a label for the one mistake people
   said they wish they had never made. “Allowing some of the best people
   to leave” was one response. “Not realizing that I was mistreating
   people,” was another.  However, if we had to create a nutshell to
   summarize the answers we received when we asked the question “What
   mistakes have you made in your career that hurt you in the long term?”
   the answers focused on one simple thing. They had nothing to do with
   productivity. They had nothing to do with performance. They focused on
   the failure to appreciate a relationship. So, here’s our attempt to
   categorize the one mistake you shouldn’t make…

   5. Not saying “Thank You” None of us would be who we are today without
   the people who work with us, for us, and in spite of us. Maybe it’s
   time to show those people some gratitude…so all our mistakes can be
   learning experiences instead of regrets.
