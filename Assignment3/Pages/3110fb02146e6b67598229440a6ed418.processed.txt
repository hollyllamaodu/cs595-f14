DeAngelo Hall Out For Year With Ruptured Achilles

   Posted Sep 22, 2014

   [Andrew-Walkerjpg.jpg] Andrew Walker Lead Writer, Editor Redskins.com
   [47]@Redskins
     * [48]a

The Washington Redskins on Monday placed cornerback DeAngelo Hall on
season-ending IR for an Achilles injury suffered in Sunday’s loss to the
Philadelphia Eagles.

   The Washington Redskins on Monday officially saw their defensive
   captain’s season come to a premature end.

   The team placed cornerback [50]DeAngelo Hall [icon-article-link.gif] on
   the injured/reserve list after the 11-year veteran said he ruptured his
   left Achilles in the Redskins’ 37-34 loss Sunday against the Eagles in
   Philadelphia.

   Hall told reporters on Monday that he’s still looking for the “right
   place” to have his surgery performed, and doesn’t immediately know how
   soon he’ll be able to get back on the road to recovery.

   “I’m not a spring chicken, so I got to make sure I get it done the
   right way,” Hall said. “I’ve got to be as patient with it as possible,
   attack this rehab and get back out there on the field.”

   The play occurred early in the second quarter of Sunday’s game at
   Lincoln Financial Field. Hall said he “just tried to break, plant and
   come out my break” with the receiver running him off when he “tried to
   redirect the ball, and just instantly fell to the ground and grabbed
   the back of my leg.”

   “I just thought I got stepped on,” Hall said. “I didn’t know instantly.
   I didn’t think much of it. I thought I had a calf strain or something.”

   Hall said he has reached out to several other athletes who have had
   similar injuries, including Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, who
   ruptured his Achilles in an April 2013 game against the Golden State
   Warriors.

   “He was probably the most notable guy that I remember having an
   Achilles injury and coming back,” Hall said of Bryant, a future Hall of
   Famer. “I talked to him for a long time yesterday about it and he said
   the same thing our trainer said which is good. I’m getting the same
   information, just to be patient with it.”

   Hall said he’s learned “it’s going to feel like you can push, it’s
   going to feel like you can do some things, but the best thing is just
   to not do anything.”

   “This being injured thing is kind of new for me,” Hall said. “I’m going
   to heed the advice of all these people, and I’m going to listen to them
   and I’m going to come back better.”

   In the meantime, the Redskins are left with plenty of unknowns at the
   cornerback position in Hall’s absence.

   Head coach Jay Gruden said rookie [51]Bashaud Breeland
   [icon-article-link.gif] will likely step up in that starting role, and
   is hoping veteran cornerback [52]Tracy Porter [icon-article-link.gif] –
   who is yet to play this season due to a hamstring injury – will be able
   to return soon. The team also signed second-year cornerback [53]Chase
   Minnifield [icon-article-link.gif] to the active roster from its
   practice squad on Monday.

   Most of all, Gruden said the team will miss Hall off of the field.

   “He was voted captain for a reason,” the first-year head coach said.
   “Guys look up to him. He’s a veteran guy and has that experience that
   you can’t coach. He communicates well with the young guys and is a
   great leader by example for the young guys like Breeland and [David]
   Amerson, and unfortunately, he’s going to be gone.”

   Amerson – a second-year starter out of NC State – said he hopes Hall
   continues to help guide him, even through his recovery.

   “Hopefully, he continues to stick around, be in my ear all the time
   because I definitely need that,” Amerson said. “Like I said, we’re just
   trying to make the best of the situation.”

   Ihenacho also out for year
   Gruden on Monday also announced that safety [54]Duke Ihenacho
   [icon-article-link.gif] – just signed by the team on Aug. 31 – was also
   be placed on season-ending IR with a fracture in his left foot.

   Ihenacho was injured in the first quarter of Sunday’s game while
   covering a kickoff. He was claimed off waivers from the Denver Broncos
   – where he started in 17 games a season ago – and played in two games
   in Washington this season.

   Moving Ihenacho to IR and signing Minnifield to the active roster gives
   the Redskins an open spot on both their active roster and their
   practice squad.

   Gruden said the team is evaluating what it wants to do with those
   spots, especially considering the fact it listed 17 players on its
   injury report on Monday.

   “We haven’t decided who that’s going to be yet, what position,” Gruden
   said. “We’ll have a better idea tomorrow after practice, see what the
   trainers say, and whatever position we need we’ll probably call
   somebody up then.”

   The Redskins also announced on Monday that they had terminated the
   contract of linebacker Darryl Sharpton, who had been placed on IR
   earlier in the season.
