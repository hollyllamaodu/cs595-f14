The Crucial Fact Most Marketers Miss About Millennials: Big Changes for Gen Y
Marketing

   [49]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Picture your “typical” millennial. Young, tethered to social media,
   still living at home. New data reveals that not only is this picture
   wrong—it’s obsolete. The digitally native generation that helped elect
   Barack Obama, embraces equal marriage rights, and cares deeply about
   the environment is evolving—and quickly. And that change is being
   brought on by one simple fact: millennials are now parents. Of the
   older half of millennials (those aged 25 to 34) over 22 million already
   have kids. Each day roughly 10,000 millennial moms give birth. Our new
   research reveals that parenthood is driving a more pragmatic,
   conservative outlook—and it’s dramatically changing how millennials
   buy, behave and believe.

   In 2013, our first study of millennial parents revealed that
   traditional values and ideals were starting to take hold in this
   often-watched generation. In just a short year, the changes have become
   even more profound. Let’s take a look at five new trends that will
   redefine how marketers speak to and with millennials.

   The Millennial Political Conundrum
   Parenthood shows a sharp increase in millennials that identify
   themselves as “conservative evangelical Christians” from 9.6 percent to
   32.9 percent. However, more millennial parents, 30 percent,
   self-identify with the Democratic Party than any other.

   This data serves as a reminder to marketers and researchers—don’t
   assume the stereotype. Millennials are a racially diverse group that
   cut across wide swaths of American life. This political data is the
   perfect embodiment of that very diversity. Church and faith play a
   vital role in the majority of minority households, and with the
   introduction of children, we are starting to see millennials cleave to
   their roots.

   Yet, there is still a large group of millennial parents that support
   gay marriage equality and legalization of marijuana. While they may
   seem to contradict themselves, one thing is certain—millennial parents
   are thinking about tradition now more than ever. They’re simply
   redefining what it means to be “conservative.”

   Millennials Letting Go of Green?
   Before they become parents, 10 percent of millennials belong to an
   environmental organization, which drops to 0.2 percent after they have
   children. In fact, when it comes to environmental issues, millennials
   are waning in their commitment to one of the most basic conservation
   ideals: recycling. Before they have children, millennials over-index
   against the general population—meaning they are more likely to
   believe/act than the total U.S. population—in nearly every category of
   recycling. After they have kids, that commitment experiences a sharp
   decline, with commitment to “very often” and “sometimes” shifting to
   “never” when it comes to recycling everything from glass to newspaper
   to aluminum cans.

   At first glance, you might assume that millennials are simply too busy
   to recycle once they have kids. But, they also report a drop-off in
   affinity for eco-friendly products. Before they have kids, 59.6 percent
   of millennials say they are more likely to purchase a product that is
   environmentally friendly. That figure drops to 37.1 percent after they
   become parents.

   It remains to be seen if this data is signaling the death-knell for
   green products. The data shows that there is still a steadfast group of
   millennial parents that are committed to the environment, but the
   majority seems to be more apathetic.

   Millennial Parent Optimism and Spending Grow
   Over the past year, millennial parents’ income has remained largely
   flat. Of those households reporting annual income of between $50,000
   and $100,000, 7.6 percent reported a drop in income; those households
   above $100,000 in earnings remained flat. Even though millennial
   parents’ income isn’t increasing, they remain very optimistic about the
   future and show an increased propensity to shop and spend.

   Before they had kids, just 26.7 percent of millennials say they “shop
   frequently,” which jumps to 46 percent after parenthood. But where are
   they spending their money? Most millennial parents report significant
   spending increases on items like household items, food, and gas, as
   well as an increase in plans to spend on big and medium-ticket
   products.

   What does this all mean for brands and marketers? Keep in mind that
   while millennial parents are forecasting spending increases, they are
   more pragmatic than ever before. They seek out deals and expect
   products to be useful and practical. If they are going to indulge, it’s
   most likely for their children.

   Millennials Drop Their Friends
   As millennials become parents, they report drops in seeking advice from
   (or giving advice to) friends on purchases in nearly every category,
   with health and electronics being important exceptions. The influence
   to purchase is becoming decidedly “old school” for the digital
   generation. In fact, 22.1 percent of millennial parents say “fashion
   magazines help determine what clothes to buy,” versus 7.6 percent
   before they have kids. Similarly, 21.3 percent of millennial parents
   say they like to “buy the same products celebrities use,” versus 6.3
   percent before they had kids.

   It’s important to note that while celebrity and fashion magazine
   influences still don’t represent a majority of millennial parents, the
   numbers have jumped significantly. Brands should take heed of this
   growing trend and not incorrectly assume that a friend’s opinion on
   Facebook trumps fashion advice from major print titles.

   Millennials and Privacy
   In what might be the biggest revelation for marketers, millennial
   parents seem to have been widely influenced by recent news of data
   breaches. An astounding 29 percent of millennial parents say they “use
   the internet less because of privacy concerns,” up from 9.8 percent
   before parenthood.

   While this may seem like a troubling statistic for marketers, the data
   also revealed that millennial parents are willing to forgo privacy
   concerns if they are offered a deal. Millennial parents who want to
   hear about new products or services via email stands at 31.9 percent,
   versus 17.3 percent for millennials without kids. Likewise, before they
   had kids, just 2.5 percent of millennials were ‘interested in receiving
   ads on their cell phones,’ which jumps to 12.3 percent after they have
   children.

   Like every generation before them, millennials are being changed by
   parenthood. It’s up to marketers to know the facts and plan
   accordingly.
