Rudy Giuliani: Noriega's 'Call Of Duty' Lawsuit Is A Fight Between Good And
Evil

   [48]Comment Now
   [49]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   If you’re going to get into a legal fight with a high profile
   Panamanian dictator, you may as well hire a high profile attorney.

   At least, that seems to be the thinking behind Activision Blizzard’s
   (ATVI) decision to hire former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani to
   represent the company in its counter-suit against Manuel Noriega.

   The 80-year-old Noriega has already spent two-and-a-half decades in
   prison on charges ranging from racketeering to murder, and will likely
   spend the rest of his days behind bars.

   Perhaps it’s this sense of mortality, of living out his golden years in
   a cage, that inspired Noriega [50]to file a lawsuit against the video
   game publisher this past July.

   The former dictator appeared as a minor villain in video game developer
   Treyarch’s 2012 blockbuster Call of Duty: Black Ops II, and now he
   wants a piece of the very large pie—the game netted over $1 billion in
   its first 15 days.

   Noriega’s suit claims that the use of his likeness led to profits for
   Activision Blizzard and damages to Noriega, by portraying him “as the
   culprit of numerous fictional heinous crimes” which he did not commit.

   Activision Blizzard plans to use this very sentiment in their
   counter-suit, claiming that the use of a public figure in a work of
   fiction is protected speech.

   “His going after Call of Duty would be like Osama bin Laden going
   after Zero Dark Thirty,” Giuliani tells me over the phone.
   “Video games, as you know, according to the United States Supreme
   Court, are treated the same as movies and books,” Giuliani says,
   referring to the 2011 Brown v Entertainment Merchants
   Association decision, in which the Supreme Court overruled a 2005
   California law restricting the sale of violent video games.

   “It’s no different between a video game, a book, and a movie and
   [Noriega's lawsuit] would open up video games, movies, and books to all
   kinds of people suing if they were unhappy or if they wanted to make
   money.”

   This, Giuliani argues, would have an enormous impact on not just the
   historical fiction genre, but on free speech in general.

   noriega


   “It’s a very, very dangerous incursion into well-settled first
   amendment rights,” Giuliani tells me. “But it’s probably even more
   outrageous because it’s coming from a person like Noriega, a notorious
   dictator who’s been convicted in three different countries—the United
   States, France, and Panama—for murder, drug trafficking, torture, and
   you know we could on and on and on.”

   Giuliani, whose law firm Bracewell & Giuliani LLP has been hired by
   Activision Blizzard to fight back against the Noriega suit, frames the
   case as a battle between good and evil.

   “It’s really a situation in which this is evil versus good and good
   versus evil,” he tells me. “Noriega is evil. The company that he’s
   suing is an American company that employs 7,500 people, it’s given
   millions of dollars to veterans’ causes, it’s helped find jobs for over
   5,000 veterans.” Presumably, this means that Activision Blizzard is
   “good.”

   This sort of good vs. evil framing hearkens back to the days after the
   9/11 attacks in New York City, a time when Giuliani was praised for his
   leadership as mayor during a national—and local—tragedy and crisis.
   It’s also reminiscent of the former mayor’s presidential run in 2008.
   But it’s the first time we’ve heard Giuliani speak of good vs. evil not
   as a matter of national defense, but in terms of free speech rights.

   As far as Giuliani is concerned, celebrities, historic figures, and
   public officials all forgo their right to sue when their likeness is
   used in a “transformative” way, which Giuliani describes as—at least in
   this case—as “situations that are pure fiction, not situations in which
   he actually took place.”
   Contrast this with the $40 million settlement college football and
   basketball players reached with EA for use of their likenesses in video
   games. “The sports case is totally different than this because in the
   sports case we weren’t dealing with narrative fiction,” Giuliani says.
   “Here we’re dealing with narrative fiction. In the sports case, the
   sports figures [likenesses] were used heavily, the actual footage of
   their games was used. There wasn’t enough of a transformative use of
   them [because] the sports figures were doing what they were doing in
   real life.”

   I ask Giuliani about [51]the Lindsay Lohan lawsuit against Rockstar
   Games and Take Two Interactive for the alleged use of her likeness
   in Grand Theft Auto V.

   “I think I can safely say certainly for myself and I think for the
   company that we would support an artist, a writer a screenwriter in
   being able to use celebrities and historic figures in fiction,” he
   tells me. “They have a right to do that. I’m used in fiction. That’s
   part of what happens when you become a celebrity, when you become a
   public official, when you become an actor or an actress, or when you
   become one of the worst dictators in the world. All of a sudden now you
   become a historical figure. Creative artists, whether they are video
   game writers, some of whom are academy award writers, movie writers,
   people who write books, and the people who do SNL every week, have a
   right to use you.

   “If this was a law, SNL could be sued every week,” Giuliani says,
   chuckling. “And Lorne Michaels is a good friend of mine, so maybe you
   shouldn’t put that in, he’ll get annoyed if I say that. I’ve appeared
   on SNL 11 times and hosted it once and I can remember all the people we
   made fun of during that thing, and it was pretty transformative I
   hope.”

   According to Giuliani Noriega only appears in about one percent of the
   game and wasn’t used by Activision Blizzard to market Black Ops II,
   both details that he believes will work in Activision Blizzard’s
   favor. ”We can’t find any evidence that anyone bought this video game
   because of Noriega,” he says.

   IFRAME: [52]http://www.youtube.com/embed/YuJdVWBvg44

   The publisher filed a general denial and an anti-Slapp motion Monday in
   the hopes of getting Noriega’s lawsuit dismissed.

   “An anti-Slapp motion basically says that if your first amendment
   rights, if your free speech rights are infringed by a case, you have a
   right to show that to the court,” Giuliani says. “If the court agrees,
   then Noriega is going to have to show that he has a probability of
   success, so the burden shifts to him. And the hearing on that is
   scheduled for October 16th unless the court calls some kind of
   conference. Meanwhile [Noriega] sits in prison sitting there trying to
   figure out what the heck he’s gonna do with his millions of dollars.”

   Giuliani, who hasn’t played Black Ops II but says he’s watched the
   campaign through to the end, including the scenes with Noriega, says
   the good vs evil motif is especially important given the nature of the
   video game itself.

   “The other way this is sort of good versus evil,” he tells me, “is one
   of the things about Call of Duty that I like, is that it takes me back
   to the old days, you know, the old John Wayne/Clint Eastwood movies in
   which the good guys win and the bad guys lose. Noriega is trying to
   turn that around so that the bad guy wins and the good guy loses.”

   Then again, even in Call of Duty the good guys don’t always win.

   Noriega’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

   Stay tuned to Forbes Games for continued coverage of this case as well
   as the ongoing Lindsay Lohan lawsuit against Rockstar Games and more
   baffling developments in the strange cross-section of litigation,
   celebrity, and video games.

       I can’t wait to hear all the testimony of people who bought this
       game because they heard Noriega was in it… oh wait, there aren’t
       any.
