Why a premium GALAXY S5 make sense

   [17]galaxy s5 prime [18]Samsung Galaxy F [19]samsung galaxy S5 news
   The rumor mill started weeks and even months before the Unpacked event
   invitations were sent out by Samsung.
   [INS: :INS]

   If you read all those rumors, it was clear that the successor of the
   GALAXY S4 would be packed with some state-of-the-art hardware, like a
   64-bit Exynos processor, iris or fingerprint scanner, water and dust
   resistance, an AMOLED display with 2K (2560 x 1440) resolution,
   16-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization, with all of this
   inside a thin and lightweight full metal enclosure. The phone would be
   running the latest version of Android, which is 4.4.2 KitKat, with an
   improved version of TouchWiz and a flatter design.

                   [21]Why a premium GALAXY S5 make sense

   [INS: :INS]

   Now, almost a week after the Unpacked 5 event, it turns out that some
   of the rumors were true while others weren’t. However, I have to
   mention that companies like Samsung are always testing out many things
   for their new flagship devices, and there may be a chance that we will
   see some of these hardware features in future products.

   Lets start with the things that didn’t make in it into the GALAXY S5,
   like the 64-bit Exynos processor, iris scanner, AMOLED display with 2K
   (2560 x 1440) resolution, and a metallic construction.

   The reason why these things are not in the GALAXY S5 remains unclear.
   We can only guess that Samsung couldn’t (yet) implement these features
   in a proper manner, or they’re simply holding them back for future
   products. Most people from the tech industry seem to be disappointed
   because the GALAXY S5 still has a plastic back cover instead of a metal
   enclosure and that it looks almost the same like the GALAXY S4. That
   the GALAXY S5 looks a lot like it’s predecessor is not necessarily a
   bad thing, especially if you like the design language which goes back
   to the GALAXY S III.

   Keep in mind that even for a company like Samsung, it’s a challenge to
   switch from plastic to metal for their flagship devices. There are many
   challenges they need to overcome to use metal for their flagship
   devices, like assuring that the network reception remains the same (or
   is improved further), or making sure that users still have the benefit
   of easily putting in a new battery when you need it. Another challenge
   is the complex production process, which can be a problem when you have
   to produce a phone with a new material on a larger scale. The only
   other manufacturer producing a single phone on a huge scale as Samsung
   is Apple – you might argue that Apple uses metal without issues, but
   it’s different for them since they’ve always used metal, meaning they
   don’t have to set up a new production line like Samsung will have to in
   order to make a metallic device.

   Some of you may know that Samsung had made a phone with almost a full
   metal enclosure, which was the Wave 3 back in 2011. It was the second
   generation bada-powered flagship device, but it was never produced in
   massive numbers. If Samsung is going to use the same sort of metal
   construction for a GALAXY S device, then they’ll have to make sure they
   can produce millions of units in a short period of time.

   However, this is a good reason why it makes sense for Samsung to
   release a more advanced version of the GALAXY S5 later this year, with
   state-of-the-art hardware specifications and a metallic design, but in
   limited quantities. The standard GALAXY S5 will get the main attention
   from most people for whom it is a great device in line with previous
   flagships, while the more advanced GALAXY S5 would cater to those
   looking for top-of-the-line hardware specs inside a body that feels
   really premium and high-end.

                   [24]Why a premium GALAXY S5 make sense

   Besides the engineering and production challenges, there’s also the
   matter of market share. At the end of last year, there were some signs
   that Samsung will focus more on the mid to low-end market in 2014. The
   reason for this has to do with the fact that competitors like HTC and
   Motorola are targeting these markets for expanding their market share.
   If Samsung will position the GALAXY S5 in the mid / mid-to-high market
   with an aggressive price, they may have a good shot at succeeding in
   their strategy thanks to the strong brand name of the GALAXY S line,
   while a more premium version of the GALAXY S5 would give them a product
   to compete with in the high-end market.
