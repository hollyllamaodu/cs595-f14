   I'm known for my strong views on mobile technology, online media, and
   the effect this has on and communication will have on the public
   conscious and existing businesses. I've been following this space for
   over ten years, working with a number of publishers, publications and
   media companies, some for long periods of time, others for commissions,
   one-off pieces or a series of articles or shows. As Scotland’s first
   podcaster, I continue to be a prominent voice in the rise of podcasting
   and new media online, and picked up a British Academy (BAFTA)

Apple's iOS 8 Rapidly Overtakes Android's KitKat In Under Five Days

   Alongside the release of [51]ten million [52]iPhone 6 and [53]iPhone 6
   Plus handsets, Apple also released the next version of
   its mobile operating system for its older devices.[54] iOS 8 is a major
   release of the platform, and five days after its launch, one in four
   iOS devices are running the latest version of the OS.

   Five days after the public release of iOS 8, it has been installed on
   25.95% of eligible iPads and iPhones. That compares to an installation
   rate of 48.41% for iOS 7, and 41.07% of iOS 6, in the same timescale.
   The [55]data was collated by Fiksu from its cross-platform
   mobile marketing platform.

   While the lower percentage figures may feel like a failure, the
   increased user base of Apple devices will have contributed to that
   lower percentage. Apple’s user base will consist of more regular users,
   who [56]will not be ready to jump onto a new OS release the second they
   are alerted to it. It’s probably more important to look at the shape of
   the adoption curve. In the case of iOS 6, iOS 7, and iOS 8, the peaks,
   curves, and troughs, are all following a similar pattern, albeit with
   more smoothing on the iOS 8 curve.

   The trend for quickly updating the OS continues, and Apple should be
   proud of the uptake in such a short period.

   The rapid adoption of iOS 8 will be a boon for developers. With a
   limited portfolio of devices and operating systems to consider, Apple
   suffers from less fragmentation than Android, but developers will be
   itching to focus on the new features and tools available in the iOS 8
   SDK. The faster the user-base moves to the new system, the smoother an
   experience developers will have.

   The percentage of iOS users on the latest OS (in five days) is ahead of
   the installed base of Android 4.4 KitKat ([57]launched on October
   31 2013). According to [58]Google’s own figures, Android 4.4 ‘KitKat’
   has a current distribution base of 24.5% after ten months and
   twenty-two days.

   It took Apple less than five days to overhaul those numbers.

       Yeah, but Wall Street is only interested in market share at any
       cost. It doesn’t matter how many Android smartphones are still
       running Gingerbread and how many Android smartphones may never be
       upgraded even though they’re less than a year old. As if it’s going
       to get any better with Android One devices running minimal
       hardware. We’ll see how quickly those models get left behind when
       new software upgrades take place because they’ll be running the
       least powerful processors and low-end components.
       I don’t see why there’s so much praise for a platform where
       everyone seems to be running so many different dated versions of
       Android. I know there are parts of the world that need a low cost
       smartphone but there are going to be a lot of compromises that have
       to be made. Wall Street needs to get over their retarded thinking
       that iOS is going away because of Android’s very high market share.

       I don’t think anyone except for fanboys think that either is going
       away. But just like market share does not present the whole
       picture, the update story is not black and white either.
       Android’s update story is indeed horrid – but for end users. Not
       for developers. I have never had an issue handling “fragmentation”
       as an Android developer. As an Android user, I have thoroughly
       enjoyed the diversity of Android devices and the choices available
       to me as a consumer. One of them is getting updates. If that’s
       important, then I can either go with Nexus phones or Moto phones or
       with the number of flagship GPE phones and now with the Android One
       phones. On the other hand, most consumers couldn’t care less. And
       for those, there are various phones with varying hardware in
       varying prices.
       Even with those, many updates come from Google Play Services which
       are updated frequently and those updates work all the way from from
       2.x to 4.x. So from that perspective, Android phones get updated a
       heck of a lot more frequently than the once a year update that
       Apple provides. Also, Apple may provide OS updates in name, but
       don’t provide feature fragmentation that I’d argue is even worse
       for consumers. Add to that, that OS features since iOS 4.0 have
       been available on Android phones from 2 years ago, it gets even
       more murky. So it’s great as a snarky comment for Jobs or Cook to
       make for the faithful, it means little for Android users.

       Not much to add to that, certainly Wall Street has a rather narrow
       set of circumstances it regards as a win – arguably that’s what
       forced Nokia to jump to Windows Phone in 20111 when they had a
       functional Linux answer.

       I don’t think you can really compare Android KitKat figures with
       Apple iOS figures considering the wide range of low-end Android
       models and the complete absence of low-end iStuff! It’s a pretty
       meaningless comparison if you’re looking for any kind of measure of
       success or penetration of the two ecosystems or even as a measure
       of the popularity of Android’s newest OS and Apple’s newest OS.
       Older low end Android models just wouldn’t be able to handle
       KitKat.

       Its a sly reference to the massive fragmentation issue suffered by
       Android Nation. This will eventually help explain why CNeT and
       Gazelle are reporting that 26% of the the iPhone 6 series buyers
       are coming back/ over from Android devices. NOTE: I had an LG G3
       and loved it due to large and quality screen. I dropped it for an
       iPhone 6. All that said, I’ll be keen to see what happens with the
       forthcoming Android L (latest OS).

       It’s a great comparison. Clearly shows that Android has a
       fragmentation issue and KitKat or the new L adoption will be too
       low for Android to continue to innovate (which hasn’t happened in
       years) and compete with Apple. Android is keeping it’s users in the
       past, like you.

       At which point does a developer target the ‘latest’ OS exclusively?
       Certanly a year later the jury is out on Android KitKat, so how
       long until ‘L’ can be counted on. As for iOS 8… about 4 weeks? :-)

       Why shouldn’t the “wide range of low-end Android models” be able to
       update to the latest OS too? (for several releases)
       I see CNET videos of _current_ phones with much older versions of
       Android, and they’ll never be able to update.

       Remember that for most Android handsets; Google, the manufacturer,
       and the network; they all need to contribute resources to each
       handset for each update. The cost/benefit is weighed up and
       sometimes it does;t match up.

       Apple’s new IOS8 was not available to many as indicated by these
       dates. I just got it yesterday and I am sure by the end of the
       week, EVERYONE will have upgraded to the new software, which is
       fantastic.

       Historically, there is an average of 45% iOS adoption. While, the
       latest Apple iOS is available to the 4S and later, many iPhone
       users wait awhile to see how things play-out. That said, 45% is a
       massive number and Apple can be proud to it. Bri-Aine makes a valid
       point above… Most of Android Nation can’t hope for an OS update due
       to obsolete components and processors. Also, the fragmentation
       issue exasperated by the manufacturers and service providers
       hinders wider adoption. Its certainly a tale of two vastly
       different eco-suystems, if not cultures.
