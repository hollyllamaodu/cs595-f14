   Climate change: Oh, it's real.
   We still have a lot to learn about climate change, about why it's
   happening and what that means. But one thing is clear: It's real,
   alright. These talks provide a primer on the issue of our times.

       [45]Al Gore [46]New thinking on the climate crisis
       In this brand-new slideshow (premiering on TED.com), Al Gore
       presents evidence that the pace of climate change may be even worse
       than scientists recently predicted. He challenges us to act.

       [50]James Hansen [51]Why I must speak out about climate change
       Top climate scientist James Hansen tells the story of his
       involvement in the science of and debate over global climate
       change. In doing so he outlines the overwhelming evidence that
       change is happening and why that makes him deeply worried about the
       future.

       [55]Rachel Pike [56]The science behind a climate headline
       In 4 minutes, atmospheric chemist Rachel Pike provides a glimpse of
       the massive scientific effort behind the bold headlines on climate
       change, with her team — one of thousands who contributed — taking a
       risky flight over the rainforest in pursuit of data on a key
       molecule.

       Extreme Ice Survey, a network of time-lapse cameras recording
       glaciers receding at an alarming rate, some of the most vivid
       evidence yet of climate change.

       [65]Nicholas Stern [66]The state of the climate — and what we might
       do about it
       How can we begin to address the global, insidious problem of
       climate change — a problem that’s too big for any one country to
       solve? Economist Nicholas Stern lays out a plan, presented to the
       UN’s Climate Summit in 2014, showing how the world’s countries can
       work together on climate. It’s a big vision for cooperation, with a
       payoff that goes far beyond averting disaster. He asks: How can we
       use this crisis to spur better lives for all?

       climate change
       Environmental scientist David Keith proposes a cheap, effective,
       shocking means to address climate change: What if we injected a
       huge cloud of ash into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and heat?

       emotional talk about climate change and investment. To create a
       world fit for his daughter to live in, he says, we need to invest
       now in clean, green energy.

       [85]Vicki Arroyo [86]Let's prepare for our new climate
       As Vicki Arroyo says, it's time to prepare our homes and cities for
       our changing climate, with its increased risk of flooding, drought
       and uncertainty. She illustrates this inspiring talk with bold
       projects from cities all over the world — local examples of
       thinking ahead.
