Second Estimate of GDP for the Second Quarter of 2014
       Posted by [167]Jason Furman on August 28, 2014 at 09:30 AM EDT
       Today’s revision affirms that economic growth in the second quarter
       was strong, consistent with the recent string of solid job growth
       and improvements in other economic indicators. But there's more
       work that needs to be done to build on this momentum. That is why
       the President continues to act on his own to facilitate investment
       in American manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure, as well as
       take steps to improve the financial security of working families.
       FIVE KEY POINTS IN TODAY'S REPORT FROM THE BUREAU OF ECONOMIC
       ANALYSIS
       1. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased 4.2 percent at an
       annual rate in the second quarter of 2014, according to the second
       estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The strong
       second-quarter growth represents a rebound from a first-quarter
       decline in GDP that largely reflected transitory factors like
       unusually severe winter weather and a sharp slowdown in inventory
       investment. Growth in consumer spending and business investment
       picked up in the second quarter, and residential investment
       increased following two straight quarters of decline. Additionally,
       state and local government spending grew at the fastest quarterly
       rate in five years. However, net exports subtracted from overall
       GDP growth, as imports grew faster than exports. Real gross
       domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure of the overall size
       of the economy, was up 4.7 percent in Q2.
       2. Second-quarter real GDP growth was revised up 0.2 percentage
       point from the advance estimate released in July. The contribution
       of business investment to growth was revised up 0.4 percentage
       point, as investment in both structures and equipment grew faster
       than previously reported. The net export contribution to growth was
       also revised up, by 0.2 percentage point. These upward revisions
       were partially offset by a 0.3 percentage point downward revision
       to the contribution from inventory investment, and small revisions
       to other components.
       3. Over the last four quarters, real GDP has risen 2.5 percent,
       faster than the 2.0 percent annualized pace observed over the
       preceding eight-quarter period. Looking at four- and eight-quarter
       changes to smooth some of the quarter-to-quarter volatility, it is
       clear that many components of GDP are showing improvement. The
       growth rates of consumer spending, business investment and exports
       have all picked up, and the pace of declines in the Federal sector
       have moderated a bit. In addition, the State and local government
       sector has turned positive, after several years of steady cutbacks.
       One area that has slowed over the last four quarters is residential
       investment, which is discussed in greater detail in the next point.
       4. Real residential investment rose 7.2 percent at an annual rate
       in the second quarter, following two straight quarters of decline.
       Previously, residential investment had expanded in 10 straight
       quarters from 2011:Q2 through 2013:Q3. The weakness in residential
       investment in 2013:Q4-2014:Q1 was in large part due to a drop in
       brokers’ commissions and other ownership transfer costs, which are
       included in residential investment but are generally reflective of
       home sales rather than construction activity. In the second
       quarter, the “other” components of residential investment (brokers’
       commissions, home improvements, dormitories, and manufactured
       homes) returned to growth, and single- and multi-family
       construction continued to grow, leading to a gain in overall
       residential investment. Nevertheless, the level of residential
       construction activity represented 3.2 percent of GDP in the second
       quarter, still well below its average of 4.6 percent from 1960 to
       2000.
       5. Real private domestic final purchases (PDFP) -- the sum of
       consumption and fixed investment -- rose 3.5 percent at an annual
       rate in the second quarter. Real PDFP growth is generally a more
       stable and forward-looking indicator than real GDP because it
       excludes highly volatile components like inventory investment and
       net exports. For instance, in the first quarter, consumption and
       fixed investment posted positive growth, while the decline in
       overall GDP mostly reflected drops in the inventory investment and
       net export components. In the second quarter, consumption and fixed
       investment grew strongly, but by somewhat less than overall GDP,
       which received a boost from inventory investment that was only
       partially offset by falling net exports.
       As the Administration stresses every quarter, GDP figures can be
       volatile and are subject to substantial revision. Therefore, it is
       important not to read too much into any one single report and it is
       informative to consider each report in the context of other data
       that are becoming available.
