Redskins Face Short Week Before Giants Arrive

   Posted Sep 21, 2014

   [Andrew-Walkerjpg.jpg] Andrew Walker Lead Writer, Editor Redskins.com
   [47]@Redskins

The Washington Redskins have a short week to prepare for Thursday night’s
matchup against the New York Giants at FedExField.

   With today’s game against the Philadelphia Eagles now a thing of the
   past, the Washington Redskins head into a very short week to prepare
   for their next test within the NFC East.

   On Thursday, the Redskins play host to the New York Giants for a
   primetime matchup at FedExFIeld. Kickoff for the game – which is being
   televised by CBS – is at 8:25 p.m.

   Thursday’s game against the Giants will be the 165^th all-time meeting
   between the two teams, including postseason play. The Giants are the
   Redskins’ most common opponent.

   New York headed into their 1 p.m. game today against the Houston Texans
   with an 0-2 record, losing 35-14 to the Detroit Lions in Week 1 and
   dropping a 25-14 game to the Arizona Cardinals last week.

   Entering today’s games, the Giants were ranked 30^th overall in total
   offense at 269 yards per game. Their defense, meanwhile, ranked in the
   middle of the pack at 15^th overall, giving up an average of 341.5
   yards per game through its first two contents.

   Tom Coughlin is back at the helm for the Giants for his 11th season as
   the team’s head coach. Coughlin – who has 18 years of NFL head coaching
   experience – has led New York to two Super Bowl titles and a 90-70
   regular season record throughout his tenure, ranking him second behind
   Hall of Famer Steven Owen on the franchise’s all-time wins list for a
   head coach.

   The 2013 season saw the Giants finish 7-9 and third in the NFC East,
   marking the first time since Coughlin’s first year with team in 2004
   that they finished below .500. This Week 4 matchup against the Redskins
   marks New York’s divisional opener.

   Quarterback Eli Manning returns for his 11^th season under center for
   the Giants. He’s led the franchise to two Super Bowl titles while
   throwing for 35,785 yards and 232 touchdowns during his career.

   The first-overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft, Manning has been known
   for his late-game heroics, setting an NFL season record in 2011 with 15
   fourth-quarter touchdown passes. A three-time Pro Bowler, Manning has
   started the past 154 games for New York, the most consecutive starts
   among any active player.

   Defensively, the Giants are led this season by safety Antrel Rolle, who
   is in his fifth season with New York, and 10^th overall in the NFL.
   Rolle, who has led the Giants in tackles two of the past three seasons,
   has recorded 317 tackles and 11 interceptions in New York. The
   three-time Pro Bowler has 23 career interceptions, four of which he’s
   returned for a touchdown.

   The Redskins are seeking their first Thursday win since Thanksgiving
   Day 2012 in Dallas. A win against the Giants would be Washington’s
   first non-Thanksgiving Thursday win since defeating the Chicago Bears
   on Dec. 6, 2007, and would push the franchise’s all-time record in
   Thursday games to 7-8.

   The Redskins-Giants game this week will be their third Thursday matchup
   all-time, including a 13-3 Redskins victory Sept. 16, 1937, and a 16-7
   defeat at the hands of the Giants on Sept. 4, 2008.
