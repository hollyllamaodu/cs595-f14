   In the kickboxing ring, Mark Miller goes by "Fightshark" — a name he
   chose, he says, because when he smells blood, he attacks.

   The legendary super heavyweight kickboxer first made his name in
   fighting in the early 2000s.

   "In the early part of the decade, I was 6'4, 230 [pounds], and I was
   small for heavyweight kickboxing," he tells NPR's Kelly McEvers. "It's
   a lot of speed and power involved."

   The fights are intense, and even just the noises coming out of the ring
   can be brutal. "Bone on bone is — not that I'm trying to amp it up — is
   pretty horrifying," Miller says.

   His interest in martial arts began in his childhood, when he was
   growing up in Pittsburgh. As a teen, he spent a lot of time around
   professional athletes: His father was a former NBA player.

   Miller played baseball in college, but kickboxing was his real passion.
   In the late 1990s he decided to start training for professional fights.
   He would later become the only professional kickboxer to return to
   fighting after undergoing open-heart surgery.

   But that isn't the only uphill battle he's surmounted in his life. In
   his memoir, Pain Don't Hurt: Fighting Inside and Outside the Ring,
   Miller details his initial rise to fame as a kickboxer, his return to
   success after his heart problems and his recovery from struggles with
   drugs and alcohol.

Interview Highlights

   On learning about his heart problem during a routine physical

   They found that there was something off with my heart — their whole
   thing was, "You shouldn't be able to walk up a flight of stairs." And I
   was training for a fight, and I was supposed to be training for the
   fight in Austin, Texas. So guess what I did? I went to Austin, Texas
   ... to train for the fight ... instead of getting the surgery.

   One day down there, I was training. I went into the locker room and I
   literally was the color blue. So I called my cardiologist and he's
   like, "Yeah, we need to get this taken care of." I had major heart
   surgery.

   On his return to the sport after the surgery

   I got an offer to come back to fight kickboxing in Moscow against an
   opponent that at that time I had no business fighting. By that time I
   had not been in a ring for almost six years and nobody thought I had
   any chance. And I ended up knocking him out in eight seconds. So that
   kind of just threw me back into it.

   On how his life changed after the sudden death of his father, mother
   and brother

   I was at a bad place and doing a lot of drinking. My mantra of "go big
   or go home," unfortunately ... I really took to it. ... I kind of made
   the decision: this has to stop. I know it's a bad example for my
   children.
