David Amerson: 'I’m Definitely Ready To Step Up'

   Posted Sep 23, 2014

   [Czarda_Stephen.JPG] Stephen Czarda Associate Writer [47]@Redskins
     * [48]a
     * [49]a

With DeAngelo Hall out for the remainder of the season, second-year corner
David Amerson will have to take a step up against the game's top receivers.
He's ready for the challenge.

   Already taking an increased role this season as a full-time starter,
   cornerback [50]David Amerson [icon-article-link.gif] is now the team’s
   No. 1 cornerback with three-time Pro Bowler [51]DeAngelo Hall
   [icon-article-link.gif] out for the remainder of the season with a
   ruptured left Achilles.

   While it’s certainly a tall task for the second-year cornerback -- the
   Redskins' second-round selection in last year’s NFL Draft -- he’s
   confident he can produce against the game’s best wide receivers.

   “I’m definitely ready to step up,” Amerson told the media on Monday.
   “And I’m sure the other guys [are ready] as well.

   “We all know [Bashuad] Breeland can play and Tracy [Porter] should be
   coming back, so I think we’ll be ready.”

   In three starts this season, Amerson has logged 13 tackles – second
   most by defensive backs on the team behind Hall.

   Amerson said he's learned the intricacies of the game from Hall over
   the last season-plus, and hopes that the 11-year veteran will continue
   working with him while he’s rehabbing.

   “We all talk in the group chat,” Amerson said of the defensive backs.
   “We all talk to him and we said we’re praying for him and everything.
   I’m sure when I see him, I’m sure I’m going to talk to him a little
   more.

   “Hopefully, he continues to stick around and be in my ear all the time,
   because I definitely need that. Like I said, we’re just trying to make
   the best of the situation.”

   Amerson uses his physical play to his advantage, and the 6-foot-1
   cornerback said the Redskins’ game vs. the Philadelphia Eagles last
   Sunday brought out a different level of passion out of him and his
   teammates.

   “I just feel like anytime one of our teammates go into a physical
   battle, a physical war, I think guys in this locker room have each
   other’s backs,” Amerson said. “We move as a family and move as a unit.
   I guess you got a little glimpse of that yesterday.

   “A lot of emotions firing, then with DeAngelo getting hurt, there was
   just a lot of stuff going on.”

   Amerson, like his teammates, has a short week to game plan for the New
   York Giants before they come to town for Thursday Night Football.

   He'll more than likely primarily match up against the likes of Pro Bowl
   wide receiver Victor Cruz – who recorded 107 yards and a touchdown
   against the Houston Texans on Sunday -- and said he’s going to spend
   extra time at Redskins Park over the next couple days to get himself
   both mentally and physically ready.

   “You’ve just got to stay mentally attached,” he said. “You’ve got to
   spend extra time in the film room. You’re not going to be on your feet
   as much, so you got to be mentally prepared. You’ve got to over prepare
   mentally.

   “Physically, you’ve just got to take it easy. If you’re banged up, you
   got to really monitor it, hit the training room, be there on time and
   do all the little things to get prepared.”
