<div id="body-bio"><p>Dr. Benjamin Blonder co-founded the University of Arizona’s Sky School, a residential science school that provides inquiry-based environmental education on a campus located in the heart of the Coronado National Forest. Because of his efforts, each year hundreds of K-12 students, primarily from Title I schools, are now able to conduct independent research while exploring the unique ecology, geology, and astronomy resources of the region. These experiences are key for inspiring and preparing a more diverse next generation of scientists and conservation leaders.</p><p>Benjamin’s vision for the Sky School was inspired by his AmeriCorps service in central Idaho at the McCall Outdoor Science School, a National Science Foundation-supported teaching fellowship in a Tucson public school, and his long-term volunteer leadership with the Sierra Club’s Inner City Outings program, which provides opportunities for urban youth to experience nature. He recently received his Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of Arizona.</p></div>

Then, she researched HIV, AIDS, and the socioeconomic factors that bar access to health care. All of this compelled Christina to join the AmeriCorps VISTA program and the fight against poverty, and she is urging other to do the same.</p><p>“I was presented with so many opportunities that allowed me to see the importance of service,” she said. “I learned about giving back to the community I live in.”</p><p>As an AmeriCorps VISTA member and volunteer coordinator for the Baltimarket “Virtual Supermarket” Program, Christina found new ways to link residents to healthy and affordable food.

During his time in service, he sustained multiple traumatic brain injuries and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. These factors made Kevin’s transition from military to civilian life difficult. Kevin struggled in his personal life becoming unemployed with multiple DUIs. He found a new direction through an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer position with Swords to Plowshares in California. His experience with AmeriCorps reminded Kevin to “redefine what it means to be ‘successful.’ You cannot dwell on what you cannot change, but you can use your ‘failures’ as motivation to drive towards your own definition of success.” After his service, Swords to Plowshares created a full-time position for Kevin within the Institute for Veteran Policy, and Resource Development &amp; Communications Departments as the Strategic Partnership Associate where he ensures fellow veterans get the services and support they need to prevent chronic homelessness, poverty and untreated mental and physical health issues. </div></div>

Founded around the site of Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill, Braddock's fortunes declined in lockstep with the American steel industry. As the town's population fell from a peak of more than 20,000 to just 2,300, its buildings, infrastructure, and economy unraveled. With 90 percent of everything lost – population, buildings, homes, and businesses – the challenges seemed insurmountable. John, an AmeriCorps alumnus and Harvard graduate with a Master's Degree in Public Policy, moved to Braddock in 2001.</p><p>Four years later John became the town's mayor – winning the election by a single vote  –  and has been at the forefront of a massive effort to revitalize the once- prosperous town ever since. In 2009, John won a second term by nearly a 3-to-1 margin. A relentless advocate for reimagining and redesigning Braddock, Mayor Fetterman's focus on creating safer a safer, most just Braddock, youth-oriented programs, attracting artists and other “creatives" to his community and to pursuing green urban renewal and economic development have been recognized in The New York Times, The Atlantic and The Guardian, and on CNBC, CNN, CBS News, “The Colbert Report” and “Real Time with Bill Maher.” In 2012, John was honored as a Champion of Change during AmeriCorps Alums Day at the White House.</p></div>

<div id="term1">AmeriCorps |  
</div>
<div id="body-bio"><p>My story is common for a child raised in a single-parent household in an under-resourced and disenfranchised community. My father abandoned my family when I was young and, in my neighborhood, young offenders were more often sent to prison than to rehabilitation programs. I grew up in south Hollywood and South Central Los Angeles. Lacking a steady home life, I took to the streets and found violence as the only way to face my daily problems. My gang lifestyle eventually led to incarceration. I was in and out of prison for four years, until I realized that staying out of the penal system for good meant making profound changes in my life.</p><p>It is deeply important for youth who are in the challenging situation I once faced – being out of school and out of work – to know that there are organizations and individuals in every community that care about providing support needed to lead a life of success and integrity.  For me, this support came through two AmeriCorps programs: LA CAUSA YouthBuild and Public Allies.</p><p>LA CAUSA YouthBuild came into my life at age 17 when I was still in prison and about to become a father. The people at YouthBuild introduced me to self-accountability as I struggled to experience a positive transformation. They didn’t define me according to past crimes, but rather, embraced me with acceptance and trust. </p><p>My development was by no means a quick process. I needed a safe space in which to grow and make mistakes. I needed time to develop confidence and self-awareness. Without the support of a role model and mentor, I could not have taken the steps necessary to improve my life. My YouthBuild program director, Alejandro Covarrubias, spoke to us on our level—he knew how to gain our trust and respect. Alejandro became a friend and a mentor to all of the young people in my cohort. He was never the “director” or the decision-maker – he was just another human being connecting with us.</p><p>My time with Public Allies allowed me to see others who looked like me and were taking on the challenge of getting an education and developing leadership skills. They inspired me to do the same. AmeriCorps members helped me to understand that I had a voice that could be used to engage public leaders and pursue change.  It was the positive influence of my peers that helped me turn my ideas into transformative social action including providing affordable housing for homeless and low-income people in my community.</p><p>Today, I am an activist. I have a passion for community organizing and providing youth with leadership development opportunities. I believe in solution-based social justice.  One of my contributions has been founding Leadership through Empowerment, Action and Dialogue (LEAD) in Los Angeles, California, which has trained more than 200 underresourced youth in legal education, social justice, and community activism.</p><p>There are many people who tell youth, “You are the future.” While I believe in empowering youth, I don’t believe this is the right message.  I believe that we are the now—not just the future. We need only one person to believe in us and show us the way. There are others like me who want to be a part of the community and contribute to it in positive ways.</p><p>I once heard that “Mistakes are a part of being human. Appreciate your mistakes for what they are – precious life lessons that can only be learned the hard way.” I live my life encouraging others to learn from their mistakes and to approach situations with the solution-oriented spirit that helped me get off the track of violence and crime, and into a life of public service.</p><p>My path is a testament to the notion that it’s possible to turn your life around if you’re given the chance.  I live to make sure that others have the same opportunity.</p><p><em>Ely Flores is President of Leadership Through Empowerment Action And Dialogue Inc. in Commerce, CA.</em></p></div>

Last fall, his leadership led to the organization's most transformative project to date: Reclaiming a 20-year, blighted land plot and re-imagining this 4-acre site as a second campus for the successful K-8 Wissahickon Charter School which will serve as a national model for environmentally centered public education in the heart of the city.</div></div>

In addition to teaching full-time, he leads a staff task force to compile and design an online collection of instructional resources suitable for use by learners with low levels of English language proficiency.</p><p>Raised in Tampa, FL, and the younger son of two naturalized immigrants, Xavier has a B.A. in Human Biology from Stanford University and plans to pursue an M.A. in TESOL in the near future. He started in adult education as a volunteer literacy tutor with I CAN Community Education Coalition in Tampa and came to Northern Virginia to foster that budding interest.

<div id="body-bio"><p>Nine years ago, Dwight Owens was cruising down the road to success. He was a teacher and a football coach and was only 23 years old. Dwight's plans came to a screeching halt on Highway 84 in Collins, Mississippi, when he was hit by a drunk driver. After going into cardiac arrest as a result of suffering several life-threatening injuries, he was on life support for 48 hours. When Dwight woke up, he was permanently paralyzed and expected to die. Dwight did not die.</p><p>Instead, he fought through months of rehabilitation and gained back basic functions and independence. Then, Dwight dedicated the life he had almost lost to serving others. He served for two year as an AmeriCorps members with Project LINC (Linking Individuals Into Neighborhoods and Communities) in Mississippi.</p><p>As an AmeriCorps member, Dwight provided peer support to more than 1,200 individuals with disabilities. He completed 48 site surveys to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities and provided more than 300 life skills training sessions to increase independence for Mississippians with disabilities. He also helped many individuals transition from public institutions to their own homes, and started a “Men with Disabilities” support group encouraging independence and leadership. As a result of Dwight's AmeriCorps service, many Mississippians with disabilities are active, productive members of their communities.</p><p>Dwight says that AmeriCorps increased his self-confidence and taught him he could inspire others through his own struggle for independence. Since his accident, Dwight has used his teaching experience to conduct many presentations in schools, churches, and prisons to discourage drinking and driving.  Reflecting on his national service experience, Dwight says, “You can’t help but feel good when you are helping other people smile.” Dwight was named a 2010 Spirit of Service Award winner by the Corporation for National and Community Service. </p></div>

First: Place matters. She believes living where you serve is the ultimate in connection to any struggle. She now lives and works in North Minneapolis, a community where disparities abound, and where families and children are isolated by race and income. It is a place where African Americans and people of color are disproportionately impacted by failing schools, community violence,  poor housing and diminished access to employment, healthy foods and transportation. Her second takeaway is the understanding that we are each born into a universal mission to do our part to make our country and world better. Sondra says, “I believe, as Frantz Fanon, the African philosopher, so eloquently stated, ‘Each generation, out of relative obscurity, must discover its mission, fulfill it or betray it.’"   Sondra also served in the U.S. Peace Corps in Botswana, Africa through the Small Enterprise Development Program from April 1992 to May 1994.</div></div>

<div id="body-bio"><p>Armed with a degree from Spelman College and the institution’s motto “a choice to change the world,” Amanda Washington set out to do just that by serving as an AmeriCorps member with Teach for America. With doctors and lawyers in her family line, Amanda —the great-great-granddaughter of Booker T. Washington—yearned to chart her own course in the field of education.</p><p>After being accepted as an AmeriCorps member in 2009, she embarked on her first teaching experience at a public high school in Philadelphia. This experience prepared Washington for her next teaching role in Washington, DC. While teaching English as a second language at DC Prep charter school, she helped many students overcome their language barriers.</p><p>Now Amanda uses the lessons she learned in AmeriCorps in her current endeavor as a graduate student at Columbia University’s Teachers College.  And this summer, she is serving as a graduate student intern with the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans.</p><p>“My experience as an AmeriCorps member helped me realize that education is not just about lesson plans,” Amanda said.</p></div>

His lifetime of service has continued over the years as he's created safe spaces for young people at the Seeds of Peace Camp, collaborated with the community to reduce youth violence in Boston,  worked as a Philanthropy Manager at Charles Schwab and eBay, and worked to drive change in the U.S. and abroad at the intersection of business, government, and social sectors. Roger reveals, “the confidence, skills, and sense of accomplishment I gained in my first year of service opened my eyes and heart,” and was the key to “empowering me to overcome a traumatic past and changing the trajectory of my career and life.”</div></div>

When he returned to civilian life last year, Tyler looked for something that would aid his own reentrance to his community. Less than 15 days after leaving the Navy, AmeriCorps VISTA offered him the type of opportunity he had imagined.</p><p>As an outreach and communications coordinator with Student Veterans of America, Wright connects nearly 1,000 veterans-focused student organizations across the country to grant and funding sources. This effort ultimately helps strengthen these organizations so they can serve more former service members.</p><p>Tyler is certain that his commitment to service will not end with AmeriCorps VISTA. With future plans to pursue biomedical research and teaching in higher education, Tyler is currently in a master’s degree program in therapeutic herbalism: the study of the properties of plant medicine.</p><p>“As I help out other vets, I learn more about myself,” said Tyler. “It just seems like it was somehow planned out that way for me to be here and I’m very thankful for it.”</p></div>
