The Employment Situation in August
       [158]Jason Furman
       [159]Jason Furman
       September 05, 2014
       09:30 AM EDT

       With today’s report, the economy has now added 10 million
       private-sector jobs over 54 straight months of job growth. This
       figure is a marker of the progress that has been made, but also a
       reminder that more must still be done to create jobs, especially
       for the long-term unemployed, and grow the middle class. Although
       the pace of job gains in August was below recent months, the
       broader trends are moving in the right direction. To continue to
       support the progress our economy has made, the President will act
       wherever he can to create good jobs, facilitate investments in
       American infrastructure and manufacturing, and make sure that hard
       work pays off with higher wages.
       FIVE KEY POINTS IN TODAY’S REPORT FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR
       STATISTICS
       1. The private sector has added 10 million jobs over 54 straight
       months of job growth, extending the longest streak on record. Today
       we learned that total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 142,000 in
       August, mainly reflecting a 134,000 increase in private employment.
       Private-sector job growth was revised up for July and down for June
       for little total revisions. Over the past twelve months, private
       employment has risen by a total of 2.4 million.
       2. Long-term unemployment has fallen rapidly over the past year but
       remains well above its pre-recession average. The overall
       unemployment rate has declined 1.1 percentage point since last
       August, and more than three-quarters of this decline is due to
       falling long-term unemployment. This is a disproportionately large
       share given that about one-third of the jobless are long-term
       unemployed. After rising to an all-time high of 4.4 percent in
       April 2010, the long-term unemployment rate has been cut by more
       than half to 1.9 percent in August, [160]an important sign of the
       progress that is being made. Nevertheless, because the long-term
       unemployment rate more than quadrupled as a result of the
       recession, the declines seen recently are still not yet sufficient
       to return long-term unemployment to pre-recession levels. In
       addition, long-term unemployment accounts for essentially all of
       the remaining elevation in the overall unemployment rate. As a
       result, the President will continue to focus on this issue, doing
       everything he can to boost job creation and help put the remaining
       long-term unemployed back to work.
       3. The last time the economy added 10 million private-sector jobs
       over four-and-a-half years was November 1996 to April 2001. There
       are some notable differences between the current stretch of job
       gains and the one that began in 1996. In particular, the
       manufacturing sector has added more than 700,000 jobs over the last
       four-and-a-half years, while it lost more than 400,000 jobs during
       the 1996-2001 period. Moreover, the private-sector job gains during
       the 1996-2001 period coincided with the addition of more than 1.5
       million state and local government positions; during the last
       four-and-a-half years, state and local governments have cut more
       than 400,000 jobs. The two periods did however have remarkably
       similar job growth in sectors like health care and social
       assistance, retail trade, and transportation and warehousing.
       Finally, it is worth noting that the two periods took place at
       different stages of the business cycle—in 1996, the economy was
       well into a period of sustained expansion, but in 2010, it was just
       starting to recover from the worst crisis since the Great
       Depression. That is why despite the progress that has been made,
       the President believes more must still be done to support the
       recovery and job creation.

       4. On a not-seasonally-adjusted basis, local government educational
       services employment rose by more than 200,000 in August, continuing
       a recent trend that has seen an increasing number of these
       employees return to work before September. During the 1970s and
       1980s, the normal seasonal pattern was that local government
       educational services employment declined in August, before a large
       back-to-school increase in September. But since the late 1990s,
       more of the back-to-school increase has come in August, consistent
       with reports that some school districts are choosing to start the
       school year earlier. Changing seasonal patterns affect other
       industries too—for instance, the usual summer retooling that
       temporarily halts work at auto manufacturing plants in July has
       been noticeably less pronounced in recent years. These evolutions
       in seasonal patterns highlight one of the challenges inherent in
       seasonal adjustment, and are yet another reminder of why it is
       important not to place too much weight on any one month of
       seasonally adjusted data.
       5. The construction and health care sectors saw above-average job
       growth in August, while retail trade and manufacturing were below
       their respective averages over the past 54 months. The retail trade
       industry lost 8,000 jobs, well below an increase of 18,000 per
       month on average in the last 54 months. Manufacturing and leisure
       and hospitality also saw below-average job growth, relative to the
       last 54 months. In contrast, health care and social assistance as
       well as construction saw above-average job growth. Across the 17
       industries shown below, the correlation between the most recent
       one-month percent change and the average percent change over the
       last twelve months was 0.62, suggesting that the pattern of job
       growth across industries in August was a bit more divergent from
       recent trends than it had been earlier this year.
       As the Administration stresses every month, the monthly employment
       and unemployment figures can be volatile, and payroll employment
       estimates can be subject to substantial revision. Therefore, it is
       important not to read too much into any one monthly report and it
       is informative to consider each report in the context of other data
       that are becoming available.
