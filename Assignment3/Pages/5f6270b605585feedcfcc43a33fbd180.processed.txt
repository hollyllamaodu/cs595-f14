Set up your Galaxy S5

   There are at least [24]14 things you should do when you get your Galaxy
   S5 and we’ve explained them in detail in a separate [25]article for
   Galaxy S5 beginners. If you haven’t read that article yet, it’s a great
   place to start!

The Galaxy S5 is Water Resistant

   The Galaxy S5 has an IP67 Certification which means it’s dust proof and
   water resistant. Don’t be shy about getting it a little wet: if you
   spill water on it, drop it in the toilet, or use it in the rain, it’ll
   likely be just fine!

Seal the S5 Every Time!

   Whenever you take off the S5′s back cover or open the latch to the
   charging port you make your phone vulnerable to water damage. When you
   snap that case back on and close the latch you need to be 100% sure it
   is completely sealed – it’s especially easy to overlook a part of the
   back cover not completely snapped in place. Samsung gives you pop up
   warnings to remind you to double check and we’d suggest leaving these
   on. They’re annoying now, but as soon as it saves your phone’s life
   from water death you’ll be happy you trudged through the trouble.

The Galaxy S5 is not Waterproof

   Water proof and water resistant are two very different things. While
   the IP67 Certification means your phone will be protected from the
   elements, we don’t suggest you go swimming with the device or
   purposefully subject it to liquid trauma. The Galaxy S5 does a great
   job when splished, splashed, submerged, and pummeled with water but
   sometimes too much is too much and regardless of what insurance you
   have, water damage is never covered, regardless of the S5′s IP67
   rating.

Unlock the S5 with your Finger

   The Galaxy S5 has a fingerprint scanner located on the Home Button. You
   can’t see it, but trust us, it’s there.
     * Set it up by going to Settings > Fingerprint
     * When registering your finger print use different fingers and swipe
       at different angles to simulate how you would unlock your phone in
       real life
     * Add additional fingerprints for yourself or other people who may
       share/use the device
     * Choose “Screen Lock” and select “Fingerprint” from the settings
       menu to use your finger to unlock your phone
     * Alternatively go to Settings > Lock screen > Screen lock and choose
       Fingerprint directly

Protect private files with your fingerprint

   You can also lock certain files on your phone, requiring your
   fingerprint to be scanned before accessing them. This is great to
   protect sensitive information, pictuers, and other information you want
   to remain hidden from prying eyes.
     * Turn this on in: Settings > Private Mode
     * Select Unlock Method > Fingerprint
     * Long press a file/image, choose settings, select “Move to Private”
       (Private Mode must be on to do this)
     * Turn Private Mode off and all files moved to private will be
       invisible
     * Turn Private Mode on and – only after confirming your fingerprint –
       all files, including those that are private, will be visible

   Private Mode being on/off can be a little confusing since you could
   assume when you’re in private mode that things would be kept private.
   Instead it means you’re accessing your private content. It’s easy to
   remember after once habit kicks in.

Pay for stuff with your fingerprint

   Smartphones make it really easy to pay for stuff without ever pulling
   out a wallet, especially when you’ve got your login information stored
   by default. Nice and convenient but you don’t want it to be TOO
   convenient; after all, what if your 8 year old starts buying games with
   your phone ? Or worse, what if a thief – or *gasp* your wife – gets
   ahold of it?

   Companies like PayPal can now build the Galaxy S5 fingerprint
   functionality into their own apps, requiring a successful fingerprint
   swipe before confirming a purchase. Enabling this will be different for
   each app, but in the case of PayPal, simply visit Settings >
   Fingerprint > Pay with Paypal under the Features section.

Check and Track your Heart Rate

   Yet another great addition the Galaxy S5 is a heart rate monitor,
   coupled with the camera’s flash on the back of the phone. To access the
   heart rate monitor simply:
     * Open S Health from the app drawer
     * Press the “Heart Rate” icon on the bottom right or select “Heart
       Rate” from the menu
     * Place your finger over the entire heart rate monitor on the rear
     * Hold still, stay quiet, and keep the sensor completely covered for
       the most accurate results

   You can also jump directly into the Heart Rate Monitor by pressing the
   heart icon on the right of the S Health widget. Pressing the chart
   button in the bottom right will allow you to view historical charts of
   your heart rate as recorded by your S5.

Control the Galaxy S5 with your voice

   There are two very easy ways to use your voice to do almost anything on
   your Galaxy S5: S-Voice and Google Now. While some people may prefer to
   [26]turn off S-Voice, others may find it an enjoyable solution.

Unlock your phone with S-Voice

   The implementation can be a bit shoddy and the results aren’t always
   perfect, but S-Voice lets you perform a wide variety of tasks with your
   voice. Simply:
     * Double tap the home button
     * Press settings in the upper right
     * Select Voice Wakeup
     * Turn it on and set your wakeup command

   You can now use any special phrase to wake your phone and perform voice
   searches and actions… although we much prefer Google Now between the
   two primary voice services.

Say “Ok Google” for Google Now Voice Commands

   Once your phone is unlocked you can say “Okay Google” on any screen
   that has the Google Search widget to instantly access Google Now. A
   search box pops up instantly and you can speak your command. We’ve got
   a full list of Google Now Voice Commands but here are some of our
   favorites:
     * Call ____
     * Get directions to ______
     * Send text message to _______
     * Remember to _______
     * Schedule a meeting for ______ with ________
     * Wake me up in _________
     * Watch _________

   What’s your favorite Google Now voice command?

Pay for stuff at the store with your Galaxy S5

   Leave your wallet in your pocket: you can use your Galaxy S5 to pay for
   things simply by tapping it on the payment processor thanks to the
   Galaxy S5 having NFC. This only works at select locations such as
   Starbucks and 7-Eleven, but man does it work like a charm.

   I always see people that use their phone to pay for Starbucks and other
   people in line seem shocked. You can tell they want to do it themselves
   but seem intimidated… it really isn’t difficult:
     * Turn NFC On in Settings > More Networks > NFC
     * Select ISIS (or an alternative) in the “Tap and Pay” section of NFC
     * Open ISIS from the app drawer and follow the steps to set up your
       account
     * Begin tapping and paying!

   Technology can be intimidating but take a deep breath and remember that
   we’re all human. If you simply tell the cashier it’s your first time
   paying with your phone, they’re usually more than happy to help you,
   and if you get a tech enthusiast they’ll probably be excited!

Use the Galaxy S5 as your TV Remote

   Technology has changed the world, but TV remotes are stuck in the past.
   Don’t be a caveman: use your Galaxy S5 as a TV remote for a more rich
   and smart viewing experience.
     * Open the App Drawer
     * Select “Smart Remote”
     * Press the remote control in the top right
     * Follow the on screen instructions
     * Enjoy your enhanced entertainment experience!

   If you’re the type to continually misplace your television remote it or
   lose it in the depths of your couch cushions, you’ll be relieved that
   your phone – and therefore you TV remote – is always easily accessible
   in your pocket!

Galaxy S5 Lock Screen Tips

   Unlocking your phone- you do it about a billion times each day. Usually
   you do so with a purpose, so rather than taking extra steps to get here
   or there, Samsung has made it easy to access some specific features
   directly from the Unlock Screen.

Customize your lock screen

   Go to Settings > Lock Screen to customize your lock screen with the
   following options:
     * Select unlock method (swipe, pattern, fingerprint, PIN, password,
       none)
     * Dual clock on/off lets travelers easily see the time it is at home
     * Clock size small, medium, or large
     * Show date
     * Lots more…

Launch Camera directly from lock screen

   Time is often of the essence when trying to capture the perfect
   picture. The Galaxy S5 lets you bypass the lock screen to snap a
   picture. Simply swipe the camera icon up (in the lower right hand
   corner) and you’ll launch directly into the camera app! If this feature
   isn’t turned on you can do so by:
     * Go to Settings > Lock Screen
     * Check “Camera Shortcut”
     * You’re done!

   Even if you have a pattern or password lock set up this will let you
   take pictures without unlocking your phone.

Put your contact information on the lock screen

   So you’ve gone through the painstaking steps of securing your phone in
   case it’s lost or stolen. But what if your phone is found by a good
   samaritan? Rather than locking them out, you may want to give them a
   chance to contact you so they can return it.
     * Go to Settings > Lock Screen
     * Tap “Owner Information”
     * Enter your name, phone number, e-mail address, or any other
       information that would help someone return a lost phone to you

   That information will now be visible on your lock screen, giving any
   good samaritan a better chance at returning your prized tech
   possession.

Lock your screen with the power button

   Some people want their phones super secure at all times and others just
   want it generally protected. You can customize the level of protection
   by going to:
     * Settings > Lock Screen
     * Scroll down to “Lock Automatically”
     * Select duration of time after which your phone should automatically
       lock
     * Select “lock instantly with power key” to force the screen to lock,
       regardless of the selected duration, when you press the power
       button

Galaxy S5 Home Screen Tips

   Your phone is unlocked and now you want to straighten up and organize
   your in-phone experience. Here are some recommendations on customizing
   your Galaxy S5 home screen.

Customize your Galaxy S5 Home Screen

   Press the home button and pinch the screen to access a quick view of
   all your Home Screen Customization options. From here you can:
     * Set and customize wallpapers for home screen and lock screen
     * Add widgets to home screens
     * Long press home screen pages to rearrange them or delete them
     * Access Home Screen Settings

Make your Home Screen Faster

   In addition to pinching and zooming from the home screen you can also
   hold down the multi-tasking button. Selecting “Home Screen Settings” on
   the bottom right will give you two options:
     * Transition Effect
     * My Magazine

   We would suggest you turn both of these off. Transition effects eat up
   some processing power on your phone and My Magazine is a bit sluggish
   and probably not worth the hassle. Give it a try… you may feel
   otherwise, but we think you’ll thank us later.

Organize your Apps

   There’s no dancing around the subject: the Galaxy S5 homescreens and
   app drawers are a cluttered mess. Take a few minutes to drag and drop
   everything you won’t use into the trash.
     * Remove apps by long pressing from the home screen and dragging them
       to “trash”
     * Uninstall apps by opening the app drawer, long pressing apps, and
       dragging them to “uninstall”
     * Hide apps by opening the app drawer, long pressing apps, and
       dragging them to “disable”

   There are lots of apps (aka bloatware) that Samsung and the Carriers
   install that you can’t uninstall, but having the ability to
   disable/hide them sure does help.

Quick Settings and Notification Tips

   Aside from unlocking your phone, accessing notifications and settings
   is one of the things you’ll do most often, so you’ll want the area set
   up perfectly to your liking. Here are some things you should know:
    1. Use 1 finger: pull down from top of the screen for notifications
       and quick settings
    2. See those toggle on/off icons at the top? They scroll horizontally:
       swipe to see more.
    3. Use 2 fingers: to pull down from top of the screen for full
       settings list
    4. Customize notification tray quick settings by tapping the pencil
       after pulling down with 2 fingers
    5. Customize settings area quick settings by pulling down with one
       finger, tapping the gear, tapping the 3 dots, then tapping the
       “Edit Quick Settings” option
    6. Change Settings View to List View – in the same location as above,
       select List View (if Grid View is active) and you’ll get a much
       neater and organized list of all the settings
    7. Turn Recommended Apps On. This lets Samsung display apps you likely
       want to access based on your current activity and can be very
       helpful. From the settings simply “Search” for “Recommended” and it
       should pop right up

Improve Galaxy S5 battery life

   Your phone isn’t very helpful at 0% battery life aside from being a
   very expensive paperweight. Thankfully, we’ve got some tips that will
   have your phone lasting longer than ever before.

Show Battery Percentage

   [INS: :INS]

   It’s tough to conserve battery power if you don’t know when you should
   be conserving. By default, there is a battery icon in your notification
   area but no indicator of exactly how much battery percentage you have
   left. You can easily turn this on by going to Settings > Battery > Show
   Battery Percentage – it should now appear in the upper right of your
   screen at all times.

Turn off unused battery-hogging features

   Not everyone uses the same set of features, bells, and whistles, which
   is why options and settings exist in the first place. However, you may
   find that a lot of features are turned on by default that you’re not
   using and will never use, yet continue to run in the background,
   sucking away your precious battery life.

   Here are some settings we recommend you turn off and where you can find
   them:
     * Motion Gestures: turn ALL of these off in Settings > Motions and
       gestures. There are 5: (1) Air Browse, (2) Direct call, (3) Smart
       alert, (4) Mute/pause, (5) Palm to swipe capture. Some people may
       like Direct Call and Mute/pause, but we prefer turning all of them
       off.
     * Air View: found just below Motion Gestures in Settings > Air view.
       It offers a tool-tip style hover features that you’ll rarely (if
       ever) use.
     * Smart Stay: this keeps your screen on while you’re looking at it
       which obviously needs to continually check to see if you’re looking
       at the screen. Neat feature but most won’t find it required.
       Settings > Display > Smart Stay.
     * Turn off back button light. You know how the back button and the
       multi-tasking button to the left and right of the home button
       illuminate when you press them? You can hide those lights
       completely while keeping full functionality of the buttons. Kind of
       neat and an option I’ve grown to love. Settings > Display > Touch
       key light duration > Always off.

Turn on battery-saving features

   There are a handful of Galaxy S5 settings that are designed
   specifically for saving battery life in certain scenarios. Here are
   some that we recommend turning on and where you can find them:
     * Auto adjust screen tone to save power. This display setting will
       adjust your screen done depending on the current picture to save
       battery life. Settings > Display > Auto adjust screen tone.
     * Keep location on, but turn GPS Off. Some people like having access
       to location settings 24/7 but GPS can be one of the biggest battery
       hogs. Samsung allows you to rely on Wi-Fi and mobile networks to
       locate you with “Power saving” mode. It’s less accurate but it
       definitely extends your battery life. Settings > Location > Mode >
       Power saving.
     * Always allow Wi-Fi Scanning. For the above to work correctly your
       phone needs to always be scanning for new networks. You need to
       turn this on by going to Settings > Wi-Fi > Wi-Fi Settings via 3
       Dots > Advanced > Always allow scanning. Keep in mind that these
       two features will use MORE battery life than simply turning off
       location and wi-fi scanning altogether, but if you need location,
       it’s more efficient than GPS.

Prepare for the worst

   If you know your battery life is going to enter critical condition
   territory and you want to protect it in advance, Samsung has added two
   new features on the Galaxy S5 called Power Saving Mode and Ultra Power
   Saving Mode.

   Power Saving Mode lets you adjust a number of settings to create a
   phone profile that conserves battery. Whenever battery life becomes a
   point of contention, turn it on and it will restrict your phone’s
   performance with battery in mind. It will block background data, block
   certain apps, and turn your phone gray scale. It is essentially a
   “start saving battery” switch that effects a lot of settings in your
   battery’s favor.

   Ultra Power Saving Mode offers the same type of functionality but is
   much more severe. When you turn it on it will block your access to all
   apps except for up to 6, allowing you to receive calls and texts but
   pretty much preventing everything else. You’re given information about
   how long your phone can last in this mode and the numbers are pretty
   impressive. If you’re in a jam, Ultra Power Saving Mode could really
   save your you-know-what.

   You can find both of these features in Settings > Power Saving Mode in
   the bottom of the Device category.

Phone & Contact Tips

   Over the years we’ve seen phones go from a calling device to internet
   and app machines. News flash: phones still call people. Update: we’ve
   got some tips to improve that experience.

   Block Specific Numbers

   Do you have a stalker? Pissed at a friend who won’t stop calling you
   relentlessly? Can’t shake a certain telemarketer? The S5 lets you
   selectively block specific phone numbers with a feature called Auto
   Reject. Jump into Settings > Applications > Call > Call Rejection > and
   add specific numbers to the list.

   Quick Answer/End Calls

   There are a bunch of features that let you field calls more easily.
     * Answer calls automatically when you pick up the phone in Settings >
       Motion and Gestures > Direct Call
     * Answer calls automatically when you have a headset attached in
       Settings > Applications > Call > Call Accessories > Automatically
       answer a call with headset attached
     * Answer/End calls with physical buttons by going to Settings >
       Applications > Call > Answer and ending calls > call with home key,
       end call with power key

   Remove duplicate contacts from phonebook

   There aren’t many things more irritating than having 3 or 4 contact
   names for every single contact in your phone book. Unfortunately it
   seems to happen quite a bit and people cannot figure out how to fix the
   problem.

   One reason these duplicates show is because your different social
   networks are all listing the contacts from the separate sources. One
   way to fix it is to select a specific source as your primary contact
   book and the others will become hidden.

   Settings > Applications > Contacts > Contacts to display > select your
   preferred address book.

Galaxy S5 Texting Tips

   We’re willing to bet that texting is one of the most used features on
   your phone, so why not tweak it to your liking?

   Customize Text Message Layout

   Aside from switching the default messaging app in Settings >
   Applications > Default Applications > Messaging, you can also customize
   the look and feel of the messaging app if you choose to stick with
   Samsung’s default messenger. Just jump into Settings > Applications >
   Messages > Display and you can change the layout along with
   backgrounds, fonts, and more.

   Don’t delete old text messages automatically

   If you text a lot your phone is going to fill up with messages rather
   quickly. To help you out, Samsung automatically deletes old messages
   after a certain storage and time threshold are met. But what if you
   want to keep old messages for your records? No problem.

   Settings > Applications > Messages > Delete Old Messages > Off.

   Display text messages as popups

   Some people really love their popups and if you’ve got nothing to hide,
   there’s less reason to keep them confined to your notification drawer.
   To have new text messages appear as pop up notifications go to Settings
   > Applications > Messages > Notifications > On and make sure Pop-up
   display is selected.

   Send “canned response” text messages

   If you use and love the “canned response” feature in GMail you’ll
   probably love the “Quick Responses” feature in Android. You can respond
   to a phone call or text message instantly with a pre-defined message,
   either using default messages that come loaded on the S5 or you can
   create your own for future use. I can’t tell you how helpful these are
   when you need to decline calls but want to give people an explanation
   and heads up as to why.

   Settings > Applications > Messages > Quick Responses.

   Cancel Text Messages before they send

   There’s nothing as awful as the heart-sinking feeling of pressing the
   “Send” button on a text message only to be filled with instant regret.
   In another feature seemingly borrowed from GMail, Samsung lets you hit
   cancel on text messages before they send with a feature called “delay
   message sending”. Brilliant. Turn it on in:

   Settings > Applications > Messages > Delay message sending.

Always get the fastest connection

   What’s faster: your mobile network or Wi-Fi? What if you’re on blazing
   fast 4G LTE? What if your Wi-Fi is puttering along hopelessly? Take the
   guesswork out of connecting to the fastest network by turning Smart
   Network Switching on. It will automatically switch between your mobile
   and Wi-Fi connection to maintain the best connection possible.

   Turn it on in the Advanced Wi-Fi settings in Settings > Wi-Fi > Menu >
   Advanced > Smart network switch.

Rename your device

   If you’re connecting to your phone via Bluetooth you’ll likely find it
   with the name SAMSUNG-SM-G900V (this will vary by carrier). Wouldn’t it
   be so much easier to find if it were called “My Awesome S5″ or
   something more descriptive?

   You can do just that by going to Settings > Bluetooth > Menu > Rename
   device … or Settings > About Phone > Device Name.

Open Certain Apps with Different Apps

   This may have made more sense to title “change default apps” but so
   many people have posed the question to me in this exact manner. How do
   I open this app with a different app? As an example, you may not like
   the default messaging app that your carrier gives you for receiving
   text messages but you aren’t stuck with a single option for messages or
   anything else for that matter.

   Go to Settings > Applications > Default Applications where you can
   select the default for a variety of tasks including your Home Screen,
   Messages, watching videos, and the list goes on.

Improve Screen Colors & Contrast

   I happen to think the Galaxy S5 has the most beautiful, vibrant screen
   of any phone on the market. For some people it’s a tad too bright.
   Samsung offers a few different screen modes that take this type of
   preference into consideration. Head over to Settings > Display > Screen
   Mode and choose from Adapt Display, Dynamic, Standard, Professional
   photo, and Cinema. The latter will likely offer the most realistic and
   least exaggerated experience but I prefer and recommend “Adapt
   Display”.

User your S5 with Gloves

   Trying to use your phone in cold weather can be a real pain in the
   butt. Responsive touchscreens work by reacting to the electric current
   in your fingertips when you touch the screen. This creates an obvious
   problem when you’re wearing gloves, but Samsung has an extra-sensitive
   screen mode that can be enabled and it works great while you’re wearing
   gloves.

   Turn it on in Settings > Display > Increase touch sensitivity and
   you’ll be good to go… even while you’re making a snowman in Alaska.

Galaxy S5 Split Screen View

   The Galaxy S5 has a nice big screen that has more than enough room to
   do two things at once. Simply hold down the back button to enable
   multi-tasking mode and drag and drop your preferred activities into the
   main window, adjusting the size of the panes with the middle slider.

   This can be particularly helpful when you’re texting someone and doing
   research on the web or on Google Maps. It’s also helpful if you’re
   using one screen as a reference while you type on another screen,
   preventing you form going back and forth and/or remembering long
   strings of information.

   Multi-window is a feature that, to me, seemed like overkill on a phone…
   until I started using it regularly. It’s great and we definitely
   recommend you give it a whirl.

Use the Galaxy S5 with one hand

   The big S5 screen and multi-tasking are great, but if you’ve got small
   hands, using the phone with one hand can be a hassle. Unless you know
   about one-handed mode.

   Turn it on in Settings > One-Handed Operation and you’re good to go. A
   simple flick in and back from the right edge of your screen will pop
   out one-handed mode that makes things much easier to use with one hand.
   The same flick in and back motion will close one-handed mode.

Stuff 128GB into the S5

   Multimedia lovers will appreciate that they can now store an additional
   128GB in the Galaxy S5 thanks to SanDisk’s new functionality. The S5
   comes with 16GB and 32GB versions but all versions have a MicroSD slot.
   Newly announced MicroSD cards hold up to 128GB and are relatively
   affordable . If your phone is your primary media device, I definitely
   recommend picking one up.

Make the S5 Easy for Seniors and Beginners

   I don’t mean to enter age discrimination territory but let’s not shy
   away from the truth: smartphones are complicated pieces of machinery
   and sometimes older folks have a hard time grasping how to use them.
   You can put the Galaxy S5 into an “Easy Mode” that dumbs down the
   smartphone interface it a more limited number of icons and options
   while also making these icons larger and easier to see.

   To access easy mode simply find “Easy Mode” in the main settings panel
   and flip it on. There’s no shame in using this mode! It’s a good place
   to start and you can always graduate from Easy Mode to become a full
   fledged smartphone expert.

Turn on “Do Not Disturb” (Blocking Mode)

   Business meetings, church, family dinners, etc… there are times you
   simply don’t want to be bothered. Samsung makes it easy to avoid
   distractions with “Blocking Mode” which is essentially the same as a
   “Do Not Disturb” offered by other manufacturers. Customize the options
   and you can:
     * Block incoming calls
     * Turn off notifications
     * Turn off alarms and timers
     * Schedule Blocking Mode for recurring days/times
     * Allow specific contacts to bypass Blocking Mode

   Turn Blocking Mode on just below Easy Mode in the main Settings >
   Blocking Mode.

Camera Tips & Tricks

   The new and improved Galaxy S5 camera has a plethora of features and
   you’ll be best suited by just diving in and trying stuff out. Camera
   tips and tricks could fill up an entire article itself, but here are a
   few suggestions to get you started:

HDR Mode is amazing

   If the lighting isn’t great and there are lots of shadows and shade in
   your frame, press the HDR Button (just above the gear icon on the
   left). This will pour a ton of color into your picture that would
   otherwise go missing. Make sure you hold the camera especially steady
   in this mode. You’ll get a lot more mileage out of the Galaxy S5 camera
   if you get familiar with HDR.

Use Selective Focus sparingly

   Samsung’s new Selective Focus mode lets you achieve blurred backgrounds
   that are typically reserved for expensive cameras and DSLRs. The
   problem is that the settings need to be PERFECT for this mode to work.
   You’ll need a subject that’s within about 1.5 feet from you and proper
   lighting. Don’t waste the chance for a good picture by rolling the dice
   with Selective Focus but if you’ve got time to spare it can be fun to
   experiment with.

Take pictures with Voice Commands

   You can easily take pictures or video without ever pressing the capture
   button by saying the following commands:
     * Smile
     * Cheese
     * Capture
     * Shoot
     * Record Video

   You may need to enable this in the camera’s settings under Voice
   Control > On.

Rapid fire pictures

   If you’re like me, you suck at getting the perfect picture at the
   perfect time. Fortunately there is a feature on the S5 called “Burst
   Shots” which lets you take a rapid fire succession of pictures by
   holding down the shutter button. This feature cannot save to SD card
   due to memory constraints so make sure you’ve got plenty of space on
   your phone before proceeding.

   If you might want to do some post production editing after taking those
   rapid fire pictures you may want to change camera modes to Shot & More
   which allows a bunch of extra options to get the best picture from
   among the many taken in rapid fire mode. And speaking of modes…

Animated GIFs and Beyond!

   The age-old animated GIFs have enjoyed resurgent popularity thanks to
   social networking sites enabling them for mass sharing and consumption.
   Dive into Animated Photo mode to capture a goofy moment or something
   worth sharing and post it directly to your social network of choice.

   The Galaxy S5 automatic mode is pretty darn good but change camera
   modes to capture the best picture depending on your settings. Just tap
   the “Mode” button and select from Beauty Face, Shot & More, Panorama,
   Virtual Tour, Dual Camera, Animated Photo, or Download to try
   additional camera settings and features.

Helping Hands: Friends & Family

   Our loyal readers and tech savvy followers probably knew most of these
   tips and tricks already, but don’t take your experience for granted-
   there are a lot of people who have got no clue where to start when they
   buy an Android Phone. If you’re the type of person that friends and
   family ask for technology advice and help, consider bookmarking this
   article and passing it along to new Galaxy S5 owners.
