[8]Sponsoring the Kivy App Contest

   The [9]Python Software Foundation is thrilled to support [10]Kivy on
   their upcoming [11]developer contest, the second of its kind. The
   contest begins by accepting entries, either for teams or individuals,
   on April 2. However, the topic of the contest won't be known at that
   time. On April 15, the Kivy Project releases the topic and the teams
   have one month to develop their applications, wrapping up on May 14.
   The organizers aim to "encourage and give developers an opportunity to
   learn more about Python and Kivy," through the contest. As Kivy is a
   cross-platform toolkit, they hope to see applications running not only
   on desktop operating systems, but also on mobile. The theme they plan
   won't be too limiting, so all platforms can join in the fun.
   Visual styling will be among the judging criteria, so they're hoping to
   see some good looking entries. "Without giving anything away, the ideas
   could range from a simple scientific calculator, to an alarm clock
   manager, a diary app, or a maths tutor," the organizers said.
   "The PSF has been a big part of helping us grow by providing us
   sponsorship," they said of the $2000 USD granted to support the
   contest. Jessica McKellar, they said, was "a big part of helping us get
   this competition off the ground."
   "The project has been getting quite popular lately, especially with the
   increasing interest in mobile applications," they said of Kivy. Part of
   the attraction comes from being able to work with pure Python across
   all of the platforms, allowing developers to leverage the huge amount
   of code the Python community has made available.
   When it comes to Kivy's development, they're preparing a lot of new
   features for the next major release, especially support for SDL2
   backends. Adding SDL support should make for a much more speedy
   experience on mobile platforms, and give them more flexibility overall.
   They're also putting some focus on some projects that surround Kivy,
   such as [12]Plyer and [13]Buildozer.
   If you're new to Python or Kivy, the organizers have created a level
   playing field that will allow both experienced and new programmers to
   partake. "Our judgement criteria will include not just areas of
   technical merit, but also a focus on great app ideas, user engagement,
   and use of Kivy features," they said.
   "So come on dive in and make your first mobile app using Python
   facilitated by the Kivy framework!"
