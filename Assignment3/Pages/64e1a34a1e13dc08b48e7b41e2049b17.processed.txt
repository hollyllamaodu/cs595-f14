   In a single year, there are 200-300 million cases of malaria and 50-100
   million cases of dengue fever worldwide. So: Why haven’t we found a way
   to effectively kill mosquitos yet? Hadyn Parry presents a fascinating
   solution: genetically engineering male mosquitos to make them sterile,
   and releasing the insects into the wild, to cut down on
   disease-carrying species.
