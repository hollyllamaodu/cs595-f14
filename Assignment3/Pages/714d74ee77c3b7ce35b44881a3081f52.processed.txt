The 10-Hour Plan Guaranteed To Kick-Start Your Job Search

   [45]Comment Now
   [46]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Do you spend the first 30 minutes of every workday scrolling through
   job postings and fantasizing about the day you’ll leave and finally
   start working at a gig you love? Maybe you read all the advice you can
   find online about [47]finding your passion and [48]landing that dream
   job, but you just can’t seem to find the time to follow through.

   Well, consider this your wake up call. You’re going to take a full day
   off from work, stop daydreaming about your new position, and actually
   do something that’ll help you land it. Here’s your game plan.


   Before the Big Day: Prepare

   First, do what you need to do to ensure you’ll have an entire day to
   dedicate to kicking your job search into high gear—ask your boss for a
   personal day, set up your email auto-responder, and don’t put anything
   else on the schedule.

   You’re also going to have to make preparations to ensure the day goes
   smoothly. You’ll be going on a networking lunch and conducting an
   informational interview, so you’ll need to do some homework prior to
   the big day to line up those meetings. More on who to choose below—just
   know that you’ll need to send out the requests and get the
   confirmations beforehand.


   9 AM: Brainstorm Your Goals

   No, you can’t sleep in and skip this first step just because it’s
   labeled “brainstorm.” The fact is, rarely do we have enough time for
   reflection in our busy lives, and a full day off is absolutely the time
   to do it.

   If you’re not sure exactly what you’re looking for, try working your
   way through The Muse’s “[49]Brainstorm Your Way to Your Dream Job”
   handout or [50]this resource on figuring out your personal brand.

   And even if you already know what job you’d like to start gunning for,
   it’s important to also consider the reasons behind your goal. Take some
   time to [51]figure out what your career values are—they’ll inform all
   your decisions as you start learning more about opportunities and
   companies.


   10 AM: Update Your Resume

   Job seekers will sometimes spend hours and hours refining and editing
   their resume, but you’ll only be getting 60 minutes. That’s a good
   thing! It’s easy to feel like you’re being productive by slogging away
   because it’s a tangible document, but in reality, you’ll do more for
   your job search by going out and networking. After all, your resume’s
   not doing you any good if it’s not getting you in front of hiring
   managers.

   First off, remember what’s important: The goal of your resume is not to
   chronicle your professional career—[52]it’s to get you an interview.
   So, you want to make sure you’re being thoughtful about how you’re
   showcasing your skills and experiences. Here are [53]43 tips on how to
   do just that.

   If you’re feeling overwhelmed, focus your efforts on just two things:
    1. [54]Quantify your impact and [55]update the verbs in your bullets.
    2. [56]Brush up your resume format.


   11 AM: Prep for Your Networking Lunch

   One of the most important parts of really starting your job search is
   [57]activating your network. People can’t help you unless they know
   you’re looking, so it’s time to start letting key players in your
   network know.

   A good way to do this is to start seeking advice. Of course, [58]not
   everyone will give you good advice, but it’s a good cue to let others
   know that you’re exploring new options and need their help.
   So, schedule a catch-up session with an old mentor or sponsor.
   (Ideally, a few weeks before your day off.) Now, do your due diligence
   and [59]browse LinkedIn to get a sense of what he or she has been up to
   since you last spoke. And before you go, [60]make sure your elevator
   speech is all ready when you’re inevitably asked what your next career
   move is going to be. Lastly, make sure you give yourself ample time to
   get to your lunch spot on time.


   12 Noon: Lunch

   You’ve been at it all morning, so take this chance to catch up with an
   old acquaintance and relax a bit. The great thing about having lunch
   with an old mentor is knowing you’ve already won this person over. If
   you’re still a little worried about the impression you’re making, read
   up on [61]how to handle lunch with someone you admire. Your main goals
   are just to update each other, get some advice for your next career
   move, and make sure you have someone who is keeping an eye out on your
   behalf.


   1 PM: Do Some Social Media Maintenance

   Don’t let yourself fall into an afternoon slump! Grab some coffee and
   take this hour after lunch to [62]update (or scrub clean) your social
   media profiles so that when recruiters search for you, your profiles
   will be job-search ready.

   You’ll want to pay particular attention to your LinkedIn profile, which
   is often the first place hiring managers look (and recruiters look for
   people like you). Check out these [63]31 tips for making your LinkedIn
   profile the best it’s ever been, using your updated resume to guide
   your edits. Keep an eye on the clock, though, because you can’t be late
   for your next appointment.

   2 PM: Prepare for and Conduct an Information Interview

   You could technically spend all day just reaching out to people and
   connecting, but that’s probably not realistic for today when you have
   so much else to do. Instead, you’re going to get the ball rolling by
   having one informational interview, either by phone or in person.

   (This is another one of those things you’ll need to have arranged
   earlier in the week. If you’re not sure how to reach out to people
   you’d like to speak with, read up on Erin Greenawald’s advice on
   [65]how to ask to pick someone’s brain without being annoying.)

   RELATED: [66]How To Have A Great Coffee Meeting–Guaranteed

   An informational interview is a great way for you to learn about
   opportunities or companies that might interest you and connect with
   someone who might be able to help you get to those opportunities. These
   quick chats should only take about 20 minutes, so you’ll have the
   beginning of this hour to prepare. Follow this [67]three-step process
   for conducting a perfect informational interview that will both get you
   the information you need and leave a good impression. One question you
   absolutely want to ask is, “Could you recommend a couple more people
   for me to speak to with to learn more about X?” This is how you’ll
   start the momentum of meeting people who can help in your job search.


   3 PM: Create a Target List of Companies

   The job search is such a huge process of finding, cultivating, and
   culling as many opportunities as possible that it’s easy to get
   completely overwhelmed.

   RELATED: [68]Should You Ever Turn Down A Networking Opportunity?

   One way to narrow down your search is to create a list of target
   companies for you to do more in-depth research about and try to find
   strategic connections to. You want to keep the number manageable, of
   course, so don’t choose more than 12 to 15 companies to target. For
   more specifics, read up on how [69]a spreadsheet (and figuring out
   target companies) helped Camilla Cho land her dream job.

   4 PM: Research Companies

   Once you have your list of companies ready to go, it’s time to do some
   digging. It’s amazing what a good impression you can make just by
   knowing a bit about the company when you’re interviewing. And of
   course, it’s not just the interview that benefits from you knowing
   more. Any networking conversation where you can show off a bit about
   your company knowledge is a plus.

   So, spend this hour choosing five or so companies from your list and
   [70]doing your homework on them—figure out their values, their
   financial health, how they interact with their customers or clients,
   the company culture, and where they stand compared to their
   competitors. You’ll want to do this for any company you interview for
   eventually, but this will get you started thinking about the key things
   that will inform the rest of your job search.


   5 PM: Send an Update Email

   Now, one last thing before you wrap up your day. It’s great that you
   reconnected with an old contact over lunch today, but now that you’ve
   done your company research and know which companies you’re interested
   in, you probably have a few more people you wish you could take out to
   lunch. (If not, here are at least [71]three people you should reconnect
   with and how to do it.)

   To warm up these older connections, send out an update email on how
   you’ve been doing and checking in on what they’ve been up to. If update
   emails aren’t really your style, consider sending a thinking-of-you
   email with a link to an interesting article you read recently that
   reminded you of them. For more ideas, here are [72]a few good ways to
   stay in touch with old acquaintances and get back on their radar.


   6 PM: Dinner

   Whew! What a day! You’re off to a great start on your job search. You
   reconnected with a mentor, got the ball rolling with informational
   interviews, figured out which companies you want to apply to, and
   learned a little bit about each. Your resume and social media profiles
   are ready for recruiters to review, and more importantly, you’ve taken
   the time to think about what you really want out of this next position.
   Pat yourself on the back and get ready for some dinner. You deserve it.

   Of course, you don’t want to let this momentum go to waste! Make plans
   to keep reaching out for informational interviews, and keep your eyes
   peeled for opportunities in your target companies (we’ve got thousands
   [73]here!). You’re well on your way to finding your dream job.
