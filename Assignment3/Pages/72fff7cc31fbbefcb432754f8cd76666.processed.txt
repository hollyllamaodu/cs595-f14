How To Find A Great Mentor -- First, Don't Ever Ask A Stranger

   [50]Comment Now
   [51]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Today I heard from a lovely new connection on [52]LinkedIn
   [53]LinkedIn, who responded to a recent post I shared about [54]Why
   Your Job  Search Has Stalled Out.  He asked a question I hear
   frequently from professionals who know that mentorship is important to
   their careers, but don’t know how to achieve it.

   He asked:

   “In my pursuit of THE job (not just any job), I have so far addressed
   all your recommendations but mentorship. This is the stage where I have
   stalled out. I have found many professionals that have shared my dreams
   and are now big successes in the industry, but find myself hesitant in
   approaching them and asking for help. These hesitations may be due to
   me not wanting to come across as needy, but I think they mostly stem
   from lacking the trigger words that would inspire acceptance of such a
   request. I really need help in this area and humbly ask for your help
   in the follow-through of this job hunting step.”

   I’d love to tackle this question, because so many people I speak to are
   struggling in their approach to finding mentors, and are ending up
   disappointed, angry or confused.


   Below are the top 4 tips I can share about finding fabulous mentors,
   and making the most of the help you receive:

   1. [55]There are no “trigger” words that will help you get mentoring
   from a stranger. Don’t bother.

   First, it’s critical to know that, to find great mentors, you don’t
   want to reach out to strangers. That’s not how you’ll find them.

   [56]Sheryl Sandberg, in her book [57]Lean In, likens asking strangers
   to be mentors to the behavior of the main character in the favorite
   children’s book [58]Are You My Mother? The book is about a baby bird
   that emerges from its shell in an empty nest, and goes in search of its
   mother.  The little bird asks everything it sees (a kitten, hen, dog,
   cow, steam shovel), “Are you my mother?”  The answer is always the
   same. “No!”  This is just like a professional asking a stranger, “Will
   you be my mentor?”

   Sandberg says:

   “If someone has to ask the question, the answer is probably no. When
   someone finds the right mentor, it is obvious.  The question becomes a
   statement. Chasing or forcing that connection rarely works.”

   Instead, find great mentors through the inspiring people you’re already
   interacting and working with now. They need to be people to whom you
   have already demonstrated your potential – who know how you think, act,
   communicate and contribute. And they have to like, trust and believe in
   you already (why else would they help you?).  They also need to believe
   with absolutely certainty that you’ll put to great use all their input
   and feedback.
   [59]The Forbes eBook To Succeed In A Brutal Job Market
   [60]Don’t let a rotten economy spoil your goals. Use the career and
   money advice in The Millennial Game Plan to get and stay ahead for
   good.

   Strangers (especially people in the media and the public eye who’ve
   become “huge” successes, as the individual above mentions) will
   virtually always have to say “no” to mentoring requests from
   strangers.  Why? Because their time is already spoken for, and they’re
   drowning in similar requests.  Secondly, they don’t have a relationship
   with you, and therefore can’t know how you operate or if it’s a great
   investment of their time to help you.

   Find your mentors among the people you know who are 10 steps ahead of
   you in your field, role, or industry, doing what you want to, in the
   way you want to.  Connect with new people who you can help, and who
   will find it a mutually-rewarding and beneficial experience to support
   you.  If you don’t know of any inspiring people that fit this bill, you
   need to go out and find them.  Here are some great tips from [61]Kerry
   Hannon about finding a mentor, and from [62]Judy Robinett about
   networking that generates amazing results.

   2. What can you do to get on the radar of strangers whom you admire?

   Don’t ask for mentorship, but follow their work, and be helpful and
   supportive.  Give, and give more.  Tweet out their posts, comment in a
   positive way on their blogs, share their updates, start a discussion on
   LinkedIn drawing on their post, refer new clients or business to them,
   and the list goes on.  In short, offer your unique voice, perspectives,
   experiences and resources to further the action and conversation that
   these influencers have sparked.  Understand that you are able to be of
   service to them, and go out and do it.
   3. Be someone who is enjoyable to mentor.

   The third piece of attracting empowering mentoring is in how you
   operate in your career and your life.  Are you somebody you yourself
   would like to mentor? Are you open, flexible, resilient, respectful?
   Are you eager to learn, and committed to modifying how you’re
   interacting in the world so you can have even more success, reward and
   happiness?

   [63]Be someone who is already actively building his/her career, and is
   demonstrating that every day.  [64]Here’s how (these terrific tips are
   from [65]Diane Schumaker-Krieg, Global Head of Research, Economics and
   Strategy at [66]Wells Fargo [67]Wells Fargo):

    - Be great at what you do – while this sounds obvious, it is the most
   important thing you can do to get noticed.

   - Ask for more responsibility – be sure to have specific ideas for how
   you can contribute in deeper, more expansive ways. Be creative/think
   outside the box.

   - Don’t be a wallflower – participate in all meetings even “optional”
   ones. Volunteer to represent your team on important department or
   enterprise-level initiatives. Prepare ahead of time so that you can
   meaningfully advance the discussion.

   - Promote the success of others – your generosity and openness are
   critical to your success, and will be remembered.

   - Build your support network – reach out to groups within your company
   and outside your line of business. Learn what they do and how you can
   help them succeed.

   4. Put yourself in a potential mentor’s shoes.

   Finally, whenever you’re in a quandary about how to get help from
   someone, put yourself in their shoes.  If the tables were turned, what
   would you want to see from this individual asking for help?  If you
   were inundated with requests for help every day, what type of person
   would YOU choose to assist, and why? Go out and become that person that
   others would love to support and nurture.

   * * * * *

   Here’s the bottom line: The answers to all your networking and
   career-building questions aren’t as far away as they seem. They’re
   right inside of you.  Just understand that you have much more to offer
   than you realize.  Imagine yourself in the shoes of those you deeply
   respect and admire, who’ve had fabulous success in the same ways you
   want it. Then imagine your “future self” already achieving this
   tremendous success.  Ask your future self what to do.  And [68]always
   conduct yourself — in life and in work — as one who is doing all that’s
   necessary to attract (and offer) fabulous, high-level help and support.

   Do you feel ready to go out and attract great mentoring?
