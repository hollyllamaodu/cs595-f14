Home Services Marketplace Pro.com Raises $14 Million From Seattle Investors

   [46]Comment Now
   [47]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Pro.com, a Seattle startup that provides a marketplace with transparent
   price data for home projects, raised $14 million to become the latest
   contender to take a shot at conquering the unsolved,
   multibillion-dollar local services industry.

   Led by former Digg CEO and Amazon executive Matt Williams, the company,
   which launched its website in May, announced on Wednesday that the
   round was led by Seattle-based venture capital firms Maveron and
   Madrona Venture Group. Previously it had raised $3.5 million in seed
   funding from backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Madrona, Redpoint
   and Amazon CEO [48]Jeff Bezos’ private investment fund, Bezos
   Expeditions.

   Pro.com allows consumers to search for regional pricing data for their
   home improvement projects like a bathroom remodel or floor tile
   installation. In some instances, the website will connect consumers to
   potential contractors that could perform the job, allowing a customer
   to book through the site after gauging various options.

   “The space is huge, about $275 billion to $300 billion [annually] from
   the estimates I’ve seen out there for home renovation and home
   maintenance,” said Williams in a July interview. “If you look at the
   industry from what we can tell there’s such a pent-up demand from
   people that don’t initiate their project because they simply don’t want
   to pick up their phone and call a pro.”

   Pro.com’s growth is indicative of the potential that investors see in
   the local services space, which has seen companies from San Francisco
   startup Thumbtack to behemoths like [49]eBay [50]eBay and
   [51]Amazon.com [52]Amazon.com introduce a wide-range of solutions to
   better connect consumers with service professionals online. Williams
   said that he and his company, which for now is only focusing on home
   improvement, believe their market could be far larger than $275 billion
   if consumers overcome the reticence that often comes with contacting
   contractors to get price information.

   Since its site’s launch, the company said that professionals had
   estimated $140 million-worth of home projects across 22% of United
   States zip codes. The company makes money every time for every
   completed home project booked through its site, taking a cut from the
   professional’s fee.

   Taking local services online has long remained an unsolved problem
   within the tech industry. While [53]Yelp [54]Yelp and [55]Angie's List
   [56]Angie's List have provided online directories for local businesses
   and companies like HomeAdvisor and RedBeacon (since purchased by Home
   Depot) have tried to connect consumers to home renovation
   professionals, there has been no definitive solution.

   Thumbtack, which provides a marketplace for all types of businesses
   from electricians to belly dance teachers and yoga instructors, raised
   $100 million in August in a round led by Google Capital to build out
   its platform. Amazon and eBay have both been testing their own local
   service solutions, with the latter toying with eBay Hire for nearly a
   year. That project, which has been in beta testing, may eventually
   allow a consumer to book a professional that can help with a television
   installation once they buy a flatscreen TV off eBay’s site.

   Entering a realm of stiff competition, Pro.com will use the $14 million
   in funding to grow its national customer base and add more
   professionals to its marketplace. Dan Levitan, cofounder and partner at
   Maveron, and Scott Jacobson, managing director of Madrona Venture
   Group, will join the company’s board of directors.

       I’m really excited to see what’s happening in the local services
       marketplace at the moment – seems like every week there’s an
       announcement of a new funding round or a new player, and with
       Amazon rolling out/testing their local services marketplace things
       are only going to heat up.
       I don’t think anyone has ‘cracked’ it yet and I don’t think anyone
       will for a while – the challenge it trying to meet the needs of
       (often very) small businesses who provide a wide range of services
       and provide a useful service to consumers.
       I’ve noticed most of the focus is on start-ups in the US – however
       I’ve seen some of the players emerge in the UK and Australia –
       especially in the cleaning sector. Companies like mopp.com,
       trustedcleaner.com.au and hassle.com are all doing a similar thing
       in Australia and the UK, but targeting a very defined niche and are
       able to meet the needs of businesses/consumers better than a ‘one
       stop shop’
       Definitely a space to watch over the coming months…
