   I write about stock markets, art markets, millennials and their money.
   Before joining the markets and personal finance desk I produced the
   investing section of Forbes.com. In that role I helped our illustrious
   team of contributors make the most of our site.
   Not long ago, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I
   majored in English and minored in art history but mostly worked at the
   student newspaper – The Daily Pennsylvanian. At the DP I served as
   managing editor and later explored art, journalism and other ways we
   express ourselves in a weekly opinion column. You can follow me on

Wal-Mart Really Wants To Be Your Bank, Retailer Launches Mobile Checking
Account

   A screenshot of the GoBank website.

   Wednesday Wal-Mart and prepaid card provider Green Dot launched GoBank,
   a mobile-first checking account that aims to serve the nation’s
   under-banked.

   “GoBank is breaking down the barriers to traditional banking and brings
   the benefits of a FDIC-insured checking account that’s loaded with
   features to a large segment of Americans,” said Green Dot CEO Steve
   Streit in a statement. The accounts will have no minimum balance, no
   overdraft fees will be charged and account holders will gain access to
   42,000 free ATMs.

   At $8.95 a month (plus $2.95 for a “starter kit” purchased at a Walmart
   store) GoBank is not the cheapest checking account around, but the
   monthly fee will be waived for customers who set up a direct deposit of
   $500 or more. According to Streit an independent Bretton Woods study
   found that customers pay approximately $218 to $314 annually for a
   basic checking account. That means even folks paying GoBank’s monthly
   fee ($107.40 annually) should come out ahead.

   Echoing a sentiment shared when the retailer launched its Bluebird
   prepaid card with American Express in 2012, Daniel Eckert, senior vice
   president of services for Walmart U.S. added, “Walmart customers want
   easier ways to manage their everyday finances and increasingly feel
   they just aren’t getting value from traditional banking because of high
   fees.”

   Back in 2012 Halah Touyalai wrote a piece titled, “[46]Walmart Targets
   Unhappy Bank Customers With New Prepaid Card–Should Big Banks Be
   Nervous?” In it she points out,

     The rise in the cost of traditional banking is one reason some
     consumers ended their relationship with banks. The FDIC says one in
     four (28.3%) of all U.S. households conduct some or all of their
     financial transactions outside of the mainstream banking system.
     They’re called the ‘underbanked’ or ‘unbanked’. Their main reason
     for skipping traditional bank accounts: They believe they do not
     have enough money to open one or that they do not need or want an
     account.

     Walmart thinks it can help those consumers with its growing
     financial center offering everything from check cashing, money
     transfers, bill payments and pre-paid debit cards.”

   Wal-Mart and Green Dot also seem to be taking a cue from (or perhaps
   aim at) a number of money management startups. GoBank offers early
   access to your paycheck if your employer notifies GoBank of a direct
   deposit in advance of your normal payday. This is similar to a service
   offered by startup Activehours, which my colleague Lauren Gensler
   profiles [47]here. Like Paypal’s Venmo service GoBank allows customers
   to send money to friends via email or text message. This is a service
   [48]online bank Simple has also integrated into its platform and
   similarities to the BBVA owned bank don’t stop there.

   Simple has tried to differentiate itself by integrating personal
   financial management tools alongside customer funds. While it is not
   yet clear how robust GoBank’s options will be, it will offer
   a budgeting tool and a “Fortune Teller” function that advises customers
   on purchases based on planned income and expenses. If someone is trying
   to buy an item beyond their means the feature might respond, “Remember
   that time you won the lottery? I don’t either.” This snarky tone, so
   distinct from the formality customers generally expect from financial
   institutions, may be derived in part from the approachable voice
   [49]start-ups like LearnVest have brought to financial advice.

   [50]Green Dot [51]Green Dot shares were up about 14% to $21.50 in
   morning trading. [52]Wal-Mart Stores [53]Wal-Mart Stores shares were up
   about 1% to $76.38. GoBank will be available across the United States
   by the end of October.

       I love this!!
       It’s wonderful to see somebody step in and serve the
       “under-banked,” who have been getting screwed by nearly everybody
       who has provided them with financial services.
       Wal-Mart keeps on improving the quality of life for Americans (and
       illegal immigrants).

       Good that this service will help those that are cash only become
       more financially structured. However, I find it interesting they
       give you access to your paycheck early. Is this the beginnings of
       WalMart gradually getting into the payday loan industry? heaven
       forbid!
