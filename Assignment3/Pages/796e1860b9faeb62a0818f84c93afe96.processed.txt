If You Think Leadership Development Is A Waste Of Time You May Be Right

   There’s a dirty little secret in [46]leadership development circles:
   many of us in the industry wonder at times how effective our work
   actually is. Sure, we can develop a rousing program, present compelling
   concepts, and entertain the crowd. That’s often what clients ask of us.
   But there are a myriad of factors that go into producing better
   leaders. How does spending hours cooped up in a contained learning
   environment actually end up producing more effective leaders? It’s a
   question worth exploring.

   A [47]2012 study found that American companies spend almost $14 billion
   annually on leadership development training. There are thousands and
   thousands of books on leadership (including mine), training targeted at
   any function or level, and executive programs at the world’s most
   esteemed universities. In other words, there’s a lot of energy and
   resources being spent on these programs. This is a good thing. We know
   we need skillful leaders, and that leadership can be learned.

   However, so many times, after the leadership program ends, new
   behaviors aren’t sustained. [48]Studies have found that adult learners
   in a lecture setting forget nearly 50% of what they learn within two
   weeks.  And consider that the most highly trained leaders – CEOs – are
   often not able to translate their knowledge into experience. The
   [49]Center for Creative Leadership found that 38% of new chief
   executives fail in their first 18 months on the job.

   So what factors make for a rich, enduring leadership development
   program? What factors actually create better leaders? What makes the
   investment in leadership training worth it?

   Here are several considerations.

   #1: Context.

   We know from [50]research that content that’s relevant to one’s own
   experience and builds upon prior knowledge is most likely to be
   retained. Leadership programs must integrate with the larger scope of
   the organization. Bringing in someone to deliver the standard
   pump-up-the-troops program may be briefly engaging, but not produce any
   behavior change.

   Before spending a dime on training, it’s important to clarify: what is
   the purpose and goal? It’s far more effective to focus on specific
   leadership skills that are pertinent to the vision and growth of the
   company and make sure the design is carefully tailored to them.

   In an article titled “[51]Why Leadership Development Programs Fail” put
   out by [52]McKinsey & Company [53]McKinsey & Company, the authors
   discuss the problems–and solution–to these general approaches to
   leadership development: “What we often find is a long list of
   leadership standards, a complex web of dozens of competencies, and
   corporate-values statements. Each is usually summarized in a seemingly
   easy-to-remember way (such as the three Rs), and each on its own terms
   makes sense. In practice, however, what managers and employees often
   see is an ‘alphabet soup’ of recommendations. We have found that when a
   company cuts through the noise to identify a small number of leadership
   capabilities essential for success in its business—such as high-quality
   decision making or stronger coaching skills—it achieves far better
   outcomes.”

   #2: Continual motion.

   A training program should be viewed as the beginning of the leadership
   development process, not the end. It’s critical that after the program
   is complete, there’s a sustained effort to maintain momentum and
   individualize learning.

   There are many ways to accomplish this. Some companies include personal
   executive coaching. Others establish a learning cohort that meets
   regularly and discusses concepts. It can also be valuable to conduct
   shorter trainings over a longer period of time, i.e. 4 one-day sessions
   rather than 1 four-day session. By stretching the learning out, you
   avoid overload and allow the concepts to be gradually advanced in a
   real-world context.

   #3: Measurement.

   This is one of the hardest ones – how do you actually measure something
   like leadership? Many well-meaning measurement protocols end up
   backfiring. Consider the number of participants promoted, which is
   often a measurement of program success. If the company has a few bad
   quarters and cuts back, then that metric becomes meaningless.

   Most companies use what my friend calls smile sheets: those ubiquitous
   ratings of 1-5 on score sheets you fill out at the end of a program.
   They measure how much participants enjoyed the program, and while a
   consideration, is not a meaningful goal.

   Companies need to carefully consider what measurement should be well
   ahead of time. Are people getting promoted faster? Are managers seeing
   an improvement on performance reviews? Is the pool of succession
   candidates getting deeper? It often takes a year or more to see this
   fleshed out so patience and clarity are both key.
   #4: Courageous content.

   Peter Bregman, business advisor and author of [54]18 Minutes: Find Your
   Focus, Master Distraction, and Get the Right Things Done, argues that
   leadership development programs strive too earnestly to create safe
   environments for learning. But the best learning often comes in times
   of risk and struggle.

   Leadership programs need to place people in real life-situations, not
   just provide case studies. “If the challenge of leadership is emotional
   courage, then emotional courage is what we need to teach. You can’t
   just learn about communication, you have to do it, in the heat of the
   moment, when the pressure is on, and your emotions are high,” Bregman
   writes.

   For a leader to actually learn new skills, he or she has to be put in
   situations that test their capacities and knowledge in order to
   ultimately improve. As an example, I often do a real-life feedback
   exercise in my programs that initially causes discomfort and even
   pushback. But participants learn about their own hesitancies in the
   process and test out new strategies. In the end, it’s consistently
   rated as the best takeaway of the program.

   #5: Clear and honest program rationale.

   Finally, we also have to be courageous about the reason for the
   leadership program in the first place. If there’s a serious deficit
   that needs to be addressed, it’s better to be honest about it. If high
   performers are being put into a program to escalate promotion, then be
   clear about that. If the program is meant to top-grade skills for
   current positions, that’s fine too.

   Everyone is well meaning, and this can get in the way. Too often,
   companies disguise, or don’t know, the real reason for the program.
   They worry about setting incorrect expectations. Just because a senior
   leader wants it doesn’t make a program meaningful. Greater transparency
   about why participants are selected and what the program will lead to
   is critical. Otherwise, there’s widespread skepticism and even
   frustration which foils learning every time.

       Being an effective leader is about being facilitator and liberator.
       Instead of looking at training program as a solution, work with
       employee to create a learning solution for him/her. Organizations
       do Training Need Analysis and use it for creating Learning
       Calendar/Strategy. This is nothing but trying to change the world.
       How about creating Need to Learn as first step of creating learning
       Solutions? Unless there is a desire and need to learn, no amount of
       coaching, mentoring or training program will help employees.
       Effective way to create Need to learn is, making employee’s goals
       and aspirations foundation for learning solution. More often
       managers tend to be driven by project needs, to use available
       training slots and distribute them among team members. Worst in
       some cases to meet minimum number of training days as per
       organization policy.

       As you say, Kristi, leadership development has failed in spite of
       $14 billion spent on it last year and thousands of books. Giving
       more guidelines is not the solution. What we need to know is why we
       have failed before we can determine a fix.
       Having had to first get rid of conventional leadership advice and
       then start figuring out what employees needed in order to excel
       (their performance eventually rose to a level 4 times higher than I
       had thought humanly possible), I have an answer. Perhaps not “the”
       answer, but it makes sense to me. I note here that Richard Branson,
       certainly one of the most if not the most successful entrepreneur
       today states that he has never read any management or leadership
       books (smart).
       The error is that the leadership industry focuses on studying
       leaders. They don’t study followers or what followers follow. But
       the truth is that like everything else in this universe, there is a
       science to people, why they react the way they do to what
       management does and does not do. This science tells us exactly what
       leadership is (it is not what the books say it is) and what actions
       will and which will not lead people to be highly motivated, highly
       committed, and fully engaged Superstars who love to come to work.
       Unfortunately, managers act the wrong way far more often than they
       act the right way. The elephant in the room is the command and
       control approach to managing people. People cannot be directed to
       be highly motivate or have high morale. But they can be led to be
       highly motivated and have high morale.
       My take is that we need a complete rethinking of leadership itself
       before we will turn failure into success. Fortunately, there are a
       few voices of reason but they are

       Tim, the best leader converts all followers (conformists) into

       waste a huge amount of brainpower on following.

       Well thought-out article!
       Ben, your comment tying leaders to followers to leaders has always
       been the foundation of my leadership development strategy. Without
       followers, leaders don’t exist.
       Three main components must be present for effective leadership
       development to transfer to leadership skill-sets:
       1) Assessment — what followers require, what those in ‘leadership’
       roles possess
       2) Targeted development — what leaders need, coaching/mentorship,
       on-going immediate feedback
       3) Re-assessment
       The driver of the leadership development process is always those
       who are ‘followers’ (primary customer).
       My approach is not difficult, but does require a shift in thinking
       — not top-down, but grass-roots driving from the bottom-up.

       Carolina,
       The jist of my comment was that leaders should not want followers
       for two reasons. Followers waste a lot of brainpower on following,
       brainpower that should be used to do their work better. The other
       reason is that followers will follow bad leadership just as easily
       as good. ~95% of all people are followers having been forced by our
       authoritarian society to be like this, act like this, look like
       this, and think like this OR ELSE. To escape the negative
       consequences of the OR ELSE, most of us decide to conform to what
       the authoritarians want, some more and some less.
       Your very best people are not followers or conformists. They decide
       what they should do based on their own value standards. Since they
       are self-managed and self-directed, they need only be pointed in
       the right direction and often not even that.

       Ben, I respect what you are saying, but I disagree. Every
       organization, from the largest to the smallest, has both followers
       and leaders. Leadership is fluid, so it can and does travel up,
       down, and laterally left to right. But to have the organizational
       environment that encourages the type of non-following leaders you
       envision, requires leadership. It with those who will allow it to
       happen — leaders.

       I certainly agree, Carolina, that converting followers/conformists
       to non-followers/non-conformists requires leadership, actually
       superior leadership. I also agree that the vast majority of
       organizations have lots of followers, even 95%, because their
       leaders simply don’t know the right actions to create a highly
       motivated, highly committed, fully engaged workforce of Superstars.

       So are you suggesting that eliminating ‘followers’ be the goal of
       leaders? Followers are valuable. Not everyone can be a leader all
       the time. Even leaders become followers at times, as well as
       followers becoming leaders. It’s fluid, not static.

       Yes, Carolina, lead all followers/conformists to stop wasting time
       following/conforming, stop looking around to find out what someone
       else wants them to be. In this state, they are free from the
       bondage of following and able to be their own person, who they were
       meant to be. As such, they become true Superstars at least four
       times more capable than anyone believed humanly possible. I realize
       this is very hard for you to visualize since most likely you have
       never seen it before. Having done this to several different
       workforces, the last a 1300 person unionized group, I know that
       Superstars who are self-directed and self-managed constitute an
       overwhelming workforce capable of burying their competition.

       Thanks, Kristi, for this wonderful article. All of us in the
       leadership development field should heed your advice. While it
       doesn’t necessary fit with your list here, I also worry that
       workshops that simply inundate people with lofty concepts and even
       concrete recommendations give people the sense that to become a
       successful leader (or higher performing professional), they need to
       transform into someone else. This is obviously the last thing we
       are trying to do, but it is understandable that some, particularly
       those whose confidence is low, could get this impression if we
       don’t dispel it from the start. Thanks again!!

       All of us as leadership and organizational development
       practitioners have probably been in the role of hiring other such
       professionals.
       I looked carefully for lofty, unpractical, and unrealistic
       concepts, where when I found them, I disregarded, took note, and
       never looked at that practitioner again.
