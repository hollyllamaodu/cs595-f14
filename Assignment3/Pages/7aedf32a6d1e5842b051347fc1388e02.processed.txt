Confessions of a Master Scholarship Coach

   [52]Comment Now
   [53]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   By Natalie Wearstler

   This post originally appeared on [54]LearnVest.

   When Shanice Miller was a high school senior, panic set in when she
   realized just how much college was going to cost her—and that she’d
   have to foot the bill herself.

   Her solution?

   Applying for a plethora of scholarships, which resulted in
   her [55]graduating with zero student loans—and a $10,000 refund. She
   then parlayed her experiences into a book, “How to Graduate College
   Debt-Free With Money in the Bank,” as well as a career as a scholarship
   coach.

   Her professional title is unique, but the need for her services
   certainly isn’t. According to the [56]Independent Educational
   Consultants Association, for every 476 public school students in the
   U.S., there is only one counselor. And, on average, most public high
   school students receive a mere 38 minutes of personalized, one-on-one
   college-admissions advising.

   Factor in the cost of tuition and fees that [57]outpace inflation and
   it’s not hard to understand why families are turning to outside
   professionals for advice on how to pay for higher education—and avoid
   student loan stress.
   [58]The Forbes eBook On Paying For College
   [59]Getting into college is hard enough. Paying for it shouldn’t be.
   Find out how to save thousands on higher ed.

   Enter Miller, who helps would-be students identify potential
   scholarships and offers an oft-needed dose of accountability by setting
   deadlines and arranging check-ins to keep the application process on
   track.

   We recently asked the guru about her best tips for finding—and
   winning—scholarships. So whether you have a child on the way to college
   or you’re thinking of going back to school yourself, her know-how could
   help you score free funds.

   scholarship

   LearnVest: Why do you think people often overlook applying for
   scholarships?

   Shanice Miller: There are a lot of misconceptions. People assume that
   it takes a lot of time, or that if you have an average-to-low GPA or
   SAT score, you won’t qualify. Also, a lot of parents think that they
   earn too much money for their kids to qualify for scholarships. But
   these are all big myths!

   There are merit-based scholarships that do not ask for the parents’
   income—they are only concerned with the student’s achievements. Many
   scholarships also don’t require you to list your GPA or SAT score
   because they’re more interested in your hobbies, passions and
   leadership skills.

   And scholarship searching and winning doesn’t have to take as much time
   as you think it will—if you know where to search and what to put in the
   application.

   RELATED: [60]Millions Miss Out on College Aid

   This must be where you come in. What exactly do personal scholarship
   coaches do?
   A personal scholarship coach can help save you time, energy, stress and
   money. You won’t need to spend hours on scholarship search engines
   because we’ve already done the research. We know where to find the
   unknown scholarships that only five people apply for.

   And we’ve been through the process many times, so we can help you fill
   out applications faster. On average, my clients only spend two to three
   hours a week on the scholarship process, which includes the time for
   our sessions.

   Here’s an example: A family I worked with was thinking of enrolling
   their son into the military because they were concerned with how they
   were going to fund his college education and they didn’t want to take
   out student loans. Turns out his love of science, among other interests
   and strengths, made him eligible for a bunch of scholarships.

   By the time he began college in the fall, he had a full ride to Old
   Dominion University—in fact, he received a refund check from the
   college—and the parents saved more than $68,000 on the cost of their
   son’s education.

   Where should students start looking if they want to apply for
   scholarships?

   Places in your local community are the best resources, including banks,
   churches and foundations. Since these scholarships are open only to
   members of the community, there’s less competition. And the
   applications usually take less time to complete, so students can apply
   to more of them, increasing their chances of getting money for college.

   Unlike highly advertised national scholarships—where you have a 1 in
   200,000 chance of winning—with targeted local scholarships, the chances
   of winning are more like 1 in 20.

   How soon should students start applying for scholarships?

   As soon as possible! I actually suggest starting in ninth grade because
   the earlier you start creating a plan for scholarships, the earlier you
   can start implementing strategies that can make your child more
   desirable to the judges.

   By starting early, your child will also have more time to qualify for
   scholarships and fill out applications, without missing deadlines or
   being too stressed out during a period when they are also dealing with
   a lot of other senior-year activities, like college admission essays
   and AP exams.

   Not many people know this, but there are also college scholarships
   awarded to kids in elementary and middle school. Since fewer people are
   thinking about scholarships so early, there will be less competition,
   making them easier to win. My philosophy is: It’s always better to be
   too early than to be too late.

   What about adults going back to school? Are there scholarships for
   them?

   There are. Generally, I recommend that adult learners, graduate
   students and students who are already in college look for scholarships
   based on their strengths and passions. But adult learners can also
   qualify for both merit-based scholarships and need-based scholarships.

   Even if you make six figures, you may be able to qualify for need-based
   ones, based on your unique circumstances. I once helped an adult client
   returning to school who never considered applying for scholarships
   because he thought he made too much, but he was able to get $3,000
   toward his education without writing a single essay.

   What are the biggest scholarship hurdles you see?

   Usually, teachers, advisers and family members tell students to apply
   to the well-known scholarships that require you to write eight essays
   or fill out 10 pages of short-answer questions. That may make students
   feel overwhelmed because it’s too much work for something they feel
   like they won’t win.
   Additionally, students are told to go through the scholarship
   databases, but
   seeing all of the scholarships that they don’t qualify for can make
   them feel discouraged. That’s why I recommend staying away from those
   databases, and looking into local scholarships instead.

   What do you think scholarship selection committees look for when
   reviewing candidates?

   They really want to see their students succeed. And they believe that a
   student who can demonstrate an immense passion or interest in a
   specific area will have a higher chance of success. Scholarship
   committees are more interested in hobbies, achievements and leadership
   skills than they are with GPA and SAT scores.

   What tips can you offer students who are just starting to fill out
   their applications?

   Double-check to make sure that you meet the eligibility requirements
   for the scholarship before you even fill out the application, and aim
   to beat—not just meet—the scholarship deadline. And as you apply and
   reapply, try to find ways to improve your applications or essays as you
   go along. Lastly, always have someone proofread your application to
   check for spelling and grammatical errors!

   What about rejection letters? How can you stay focused if you’ve been
   turned down?

   Rejection letters sting. It’s like getting a bad grade on an assignment
   that you worked really hard on. But a rejection isn’t plastered across
   your forehead—no one even has to know, unless you tell them!

   The good thing is that a rejection won’t sting for long, because if
   you’ve applied to many scholarships, you should receive a winning
   letter very soon. Until then, see what you can enhance in your
   applications—and keep applying. Get back out there and tell yourself
   that you’ll hit the next one out of the park!

   Any parting advice?

   The hardest part is just getting started. It can feel overwhelming at
   first, but every time you do an application, the process will get a lot
   easier.

   So find one scholarship that you’re eligible for, fill out the
   application and submit it. Once you’ve completed that one, repeat the
   process with a second one and just keep going. It’s better to take on
   one at a time, rather than gathering 20 scholarship applications and
   then not filling out a single one.
