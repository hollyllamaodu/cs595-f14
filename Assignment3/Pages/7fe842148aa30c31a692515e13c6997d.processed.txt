Richard Branson's Three Most Important Leadership Principles

   [49]Comment Now
   [50]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   I caught up with Sir Richard Branson, as he was releasing his latest
   book, [51]The Virgin Way: Everything I Know About Leadership. Branson
   is an international entrepreneur, adventurer, icon, and the founder of
   the Virgin Group. The Virgin Group is one of the world’s most
   recognized and respected brands, with over 400 companies. His previous
   best-selling books include Like a Virgin: Secrets They Won’t Teach You
   at Business School, Losing My Virginity, Screw It, Let’s Do It,
   Business Stripped Bare, Reach for the Skies and Screw Business As
   Usual. According to the Forbes 2012 list of billionaires, Branson is
   the sixth richest citizen of the United Kingdom, with an estimated net
   worth of US$4.6 billion. Today, Branson’s Pioneering Commercial
   Spaceflight Virgin Galactic announced a global partnership with Grey
   Goose Vodka.

   You can read [52]Branson’s blog or follow him on Twitter for more live
   updates from his extraordinary life [53]@richardbranson. In the
   following interview, Branson talks about his rule-breaking leadership
   style, his involvement in hiring and selecting leaders for Virgin, how
   he originally came up with his companies values and mission, and more.

   branson Dan Schawbel: How would you describe your leadership style? How
   do you believe this style makes your company culture unique?

   Richard Branson: Rule-breaker – because I never learned the rules in
   the first place. To change the game is at the heart of what Virgin
   stands for, so the company culture has always been: “Don’t sweat it:
   rules were meant to be broken.”

   Schawbel: What is your process for selecting leaders at Virgin? What
   qualities do you look for in new leaders and what qualities are your
   biggest turnoffs?

   Branson: I’m quite involved in hiring for leadership and I look to hire
   my weaknesses. Personality before CV. A person who has multiple degrees
   in your field isn’t always better than someone with broad experience
   and a wonderful personality. I like to take chances on people, and
   whenever possible, promote from within – it sends a great message to
   everyone in the company when someone demonstrates a passion for the job
   and leadership skills at every step along the way and is rewarded with
   a leadership role.

   Schawbel: How did you originally come up with Virgin’s values, vision
   and mission and then find the right people who believed in you and the
   company?

   Branson: The Virgin values have and will always be the same: to change
   the game and challenge the status quo by providing a product or service
   of great use. My first business venture was Student magazine. Along the
   way, we saw gaps in the market where Virgin could play a role and can
   be an incredible force for good, and that’s become our motto. If you
   love what you do and if you believe in what you do, others will share
   your enthusiasm. Passionate people find their way to the Virgin Group,
   and when they do, we snap them up and try to keep them within the
   family.

   billionaires, writers and businesspeople have to offer.

   Schawbel: From the beginning, how often would you research what your
   competitors were doing? What did you learn from them early on that
   helped you develop your branding strategy?

   Branson: Researching the competition has never been the Virgin way.
   Many of our products and services come about because we pay attention
   to what the market is missing or what’s not being done well. The
   commitment is about doing things differently.

   Our strategy has been to screw business as usual. To look at what it is
   our customer wants, and what it is the industry needs, and to go in and
   exceed their expectations. And we’ve been successful not by wasting
   time scrutinising our competitors but by looking at ourselves from the
   point of view of our customers do and seeking feedback through
   listening.

   Schawbel: What are your top three leadership principles?

   Branson: 1. Listening is one of the most important skills that anyone
   can have. That’s a very Virgin trait. Listening enables us to learn
   from each other, from the marketplace, and from the mistake that must
   be made in order to get anywhere that is original and disruptive. I
   learn so much from guests and employees that way.

   2. Learn: Learning and leadership go together. Too much credit goes to
   me for what we have achieved at Virgin but the successes happen from
   working and learning with some of the world’s most inspiring and
   inspired people.

   3. Laughter: My number one rule in business, and in life, is to enjoy
   what you do. Running a business involves long hours and hard decisions;
   if you don’t have the passion to keep you going, your business will
   more than likely fail. If you don’t enjoy what you are doing, then you
   shouldn’t be doing it.
