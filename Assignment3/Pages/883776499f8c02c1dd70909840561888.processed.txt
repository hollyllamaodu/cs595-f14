Mobile Master: KakaoTalk Creator Becomes One Of South Korea's Richest
Billionaires

   This story appears in the October 20, 2014 issue of Forbes Asia.

   Kakao Corp. Chairman and cofounder Brian Kim Bum-Soo is worth at least
   $3.4 billion ahead of his company's merger and public stock listing
   with South Korean internet company Daum. (Photo courtesy of Kakao
   Corp.)

   On KakaoTalk, South Korea’s number one mobile-messaging service, users
   spend hours crushing candy on popular games, sharing photos and videos
   with friends, and sending cute emoticons and digital stickers. That’s
   all thanks to Kakao Corp. cofounder and chairman, “Brian” [48]Kim
   Bum-Soo, who launched the service in 2010 and ever since has been
   perfecting a mobile universe inhabited by 93% of domestic smartphone
   users–or nearly 75% of the country’s 50 million people. KakaoTalk has
   now made Kim a billionaire.

   Kakao is merging with Daum, the country’s second-largest Internet
   portal, and is listing on the South Korean Stock Exchange on Oct. 1.
   Kim, 48, will own 40% of the combined company, and analysts predict a
   minimum value of $8.5 billion. On that basis Kim will be worth at least
   $3.4 billion, putting him among the country’s ten richest people. In
   April, a month before the Kakao-Daum deal was announced, FORBES ASIA
   estimated his wealth at $960 million. “Korea is known as the ‘land of
   the morning calm,’ and I would call him the ‘morning calm billionaire,’
   ” says Eric Kim, a managing partner at Goodwater Capital who sits on
   Kakao’s board. “ He is a thoughtful, brilliant entrepreneur who’s made
   it his personal mission to have Kakao thrive as a global communications
   platform.” (Through a company spokeswoman, Brian Kim declined to
   comment for this story.)

   While Kakao, in Pangyo–south of Seoul–has certainly aimed globally, its
   greatest success has come at home. It boasts 50 million users who are
   active monthly, of which three-quarters are Koreans who’ve ditched SMS
   text messages for the ease of KakaoTalk. More important, KakaoTalk has
   evolved into a platform where users can spend time gaming, shopping and
   social networking. That’s created a highly lucrative technology company
   in a country that is behind only the U.S. and Japan in total
   Android-app-store revenue, according to AppAnnie. Overall, Kakao has
   158 million registered users, with many of them in Japan, Southeast
   Asia and the U.S.

   Kakao’s emergence as the dominant player in South Korea can be
   attributed to Kim’s prescient timing in starting his company, says
   Joseph Chung, an analyst at Woori Investment & Securities. Smartphones
   arrived in the country around 2009, and Kim quickly seized the
   opportunity to develop a messenger that could replace clunky SMS texts.
   He launched KakaoTalk in March of the following year, undercutting
   U.S.-based WhatsApp by offering itself for free (as opposed to
   WhatsApp’a annual 99-cent fee) and catering directly to Koreans. Kim
   and his team were also fast in creating apps for Kakao, especially
   games that made users more dependent on the service and eventually
   allowed it to generate revenue. “People had doubts that [the mobile
   messenger] could be monetized even though it was a big traffic gainer,”
   says Woori’s Chung. “But Brian Kim had insight on how to monetize
   social games like those made famous in the U.S. with Zynga and
   [49]Facebook.”

   Games such as Anipang, a social puzzle game, and Candy Crush, a Western
   diversion modified for the KakaoTalk platform, make up 64% of the
   company’s revenue, according to Chung. Kakao says its revenue hit $200
   million last year, and profits came in at $52 million, making it one of
   just a few mobile-messaging companies that have turned a profit. That
   makes the company a hot property in light of high-profile acquisitions
   of moneylosing outfits–such as [50]Rakuten [51]Rakuten of Japan’s $900
   million purchase of Viber this year–and investment rounds at
   astronomical valuations (see: Snapchat and Tango). Some analysts are
   valuing the new company, which is expected to be called Daum Kakao, at
   more than $10 billion. (Daum’s founder, Lee Jae-Woong, will have about
   a 3% stake.)

   A valuation that high would serve as validation for Kim, who’s ceded
   day-to-day control of Kakao to co-chief executives Lee Jae-Beom and
   Sirgoo Lee but remains chairman. The son of parents who didn’t make it
   past grade school, Kim grew up dirt poor in Dam-yang in a family of
   eight that shared one bedroom. He found his escape when he was accepted
   into Seoul National University; he paid his way through school by
   offering private tutoring, and he sometimes skipped meals to save
   money.

   After finishing with undergraduate and master’s degrees in industrial
   engineering, Kim worked at Samsung for six years, leaving in 1998 to
   found online gaming company Hangame. He merged that company with
   another Korean Internet outfit, Naver, in 2000, creating NHN, which
   would come to dominate the country’s search and Web portal traffic.

   Kim served as NHN’s CEO and in other leadership roles until his
   departure in 2007 after differences with [52]Naver [53]Naver founder
   [54]Lee Hae-Jin over the direction of the business. After dabbling in a
   series of Web 2.0 experiments, Kim dove into Kakao after seeing the
   rising prominence of smartphone technology. “I once asked him, “How big
   do you want to make this?’ ” recalls Osuke Honda, a partner with
   venture capital firm DCM who invested in KakaoTalk’s first round of
   institutional funding in 2011. “ I asked him, ‘What if Facebook came
   and offered $1 billion?’ ‘My former company is worth $10 billion,’ he
   said. ‘I want to make Kakao bigger than NHN.’ ”

   0923_forbesasia-kakao-chart_800

   Some of Kim’s biggest competition comes from his old company, which
   started its own mobile messenger, Line, a year after KakaoTalk began.
   Once derided by Kakao fans as a copycat, Line has come nowhere near
   dethroning Kakao in South Korea, but it has become the dominant
   messaging service in Japan and has made a wider global impact. It
   reached the 470 million registered-user mark this summer, and Lee’s
   wealth topped $1 billion this year. (Last year NHN split into NHN
   Entertainment and Naver Corp., and Line, a Naver unit, filed in July
   for an initial public offering with a $10 billion valuation.)

   KakaoTalk’s ability to spread to other markets is further confined by
   other mobile-messaging competitors, from WhatsApp to China-based
   Tencent’s WeChat, all elbowing each other to find the next emerging
   market. Thus far it hasn’t been successful in finding a new market
   where it can replicate South Korea’s fanaticism for its products.
   “Kakao is trying to expand its user base in Southeast Asia, but Line
   and WeChat are much, much stronger there,” says Woori analyst Chung,
   who sees the company’s growth opportunities in the addition of more
   features for current users. “It’s all domestic business [for Kakao].”

   Indeed, the company is churning out new products and ideas that will
   make KakaoTalk even more ubiquitous in the lives of its users. Last
   year the company launched music and style applications, with the latter
   featuring deals on clothing that users can take advantage of themselves
   or send as gifts for friends. Last month the company got into the
   mobile-payments game with KakaoPay, and an Uber-esque
   smartphone-linked taxi service may soon be on the way. For the “morning
   calm billionaire,” the mobile universe is ever expanding.
