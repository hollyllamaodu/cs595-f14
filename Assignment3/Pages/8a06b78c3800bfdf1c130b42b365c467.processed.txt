Flash Forward: Cheap Memory Allows Apple To Keep Margins High While Improving
The iPhone

   The insides of an iPhone 6 Plus (Image credit: iFixit)

   The wizards at IHS have [50]torn apart the latest iPhone and concluded
   that it cost Apple right around $200 to build. Given than an iPhone 6
   carries a retail price before subsidy of $649, that means Apple will
   earn an astounding 69 percent on the phone before accounting for things
   like software, warranty and support costs. Perhaps more remarkable,
   though, is the near metronome-like consistency in that figure over the
   past several years. From the introduction of the iPhone 4s through the
   6, Apple’s phones have come to market with a build cost of between $195
   and $207 while gaining capabilities every year. That this year’s model
   is smack in the middle of that range speaks to both Apple’s ability to
   manage its supply chain and also the relentless price declines of some
   key iPhone components as time passes.

   Then and now

   The 4s, when it came to market 3 years ago in 2011, lacked many
   features of the current models. It didn’t have 4G LTE, for starters,
   being Apple’s last 3G-only model. But it also lacked the TouchID
   fingerprint sensor and had just a 3.5-inch touchscreen, smaller than
   the 4-inch one in the 5/5s and, of course, the 4.7-inch display in the
   iPhone 6. Still with a much less capable radio and much smaller
   display, the iPhone 4s cost Apple $196, [51]IHS reported at the time.
   Of that, Apple was spending $19.20 on flash memory to store your
   pictures, music and apps and $9.10 on RAM to allow you to run those
   apps.

   Move ahead to today and that $28.30 has been sliced to $15. With the
   extra $13, Apple has been able to spend $8 more on the display ($45 vs.
   $37) and more on the processor ($20 vs. $15). Those two components
   provide many of the performance gains that have occurred over the past
   3 years, allowing apps to run faster and, obviously, allowing you a
   better view of what you’re doing. But today’s screens are also higher
   in quality, with better contrast and color.

   Still, Apple has done things like adding like the TouchID fingerprint
   sensor, which IHS estimated at upwards of $15. To find the budget for
   that, the company has managed to save significantly on the cost of
   cameras, even though they, too, have improved annually. The cost has
   fallen from $17.60 to $11. Smaller savings have been found in power
   management, WiFi and Bluetooth. Those have helped free up budget for
   things like the NFC chip that enables Apple Pay in the new phones. The
   sum total is that today’s iPhone is just $4 more costly but far more
   than $4 more capable.

   Interestingly, while Apple appears to buying screens from LG Display
   and Japan Display — cutting out Samsung — it seems certain that the A8
   processor is still being made by both its rival as well as TSMC, with
   each supplying have IHS thinks. Samsung has traditionally been the sole
   manufacturer of Apple’s A-series processors. Another longtime partner,
   however, is still in favor as Corning’s Gorilla Glass is still
   protecting the screen after countless feints and rumors suggesting
   Apple was switching to sapphire proved either false or premature,
   depending on who you believe.

   The pluses (without many minuses)

   Some major changes should allow Apple to capture even higher margins
   this year than in the recent past. While the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus is
   unlikely to sell in anywhere near the volumes of the 6, it will capture
   many more margin dollars for every unit that moves. IHS says the
   incremental build cost is just $15.50, with half of that coming from
   the big screen and a bit from the optical image stabilization in the
   camera. Apple charges $100 more, of course, for the larger model.

   That could mean that upselling to the Plus now eclipses what had been
   the most profitable part of the Apple empire: Upselling to larger
   amounts of storage on iPhones. In past years, Apple got an extra $100
   to move you from 16GB to 32GB and then $100 more to go to 64GB. This
   year, the first $100 takes you all the way to 64GB.

   With IHS speculating that Apple is paying 42 cents per gigabyte, that
   makes the cost of the extra flash $20.16. And the 64 to 128 upgrade
   runs Apple $26.88. While the margins on those upgrades are still the
   kind of thing that most gadget makers would kill for, it’s a
   significant reduction from the recent past. With the iPhone 5s, for
   example, IHS believes Apple spent just $10-20 on the upgrade tiers
   while getting $100 more for them. Back in the 4s days, those figures
   were $20 and $40, respectively, which serves as a reminder of the march
   of technology’s progress. Apple makes more margin today offering you a
   boost from 64GB to 128GB for $100 than it did offering the upgrade from
   32GB to 64GB back in 2011. Everybody’s a winner thanks to Moore’s Law.

   Early anecdotal reporting suggests that the change to the upgrade tiers
   is motivating more buyers to select the 64GB this year than had
   selected the 32GB models in the past. Whether that sticks past the
   early upgraders remains to be seen, but it could have positive
   implications for Apple in the form of [52]higher average selling prices
   on iPhones and improved gross margins. What’s especially noteworthy is
   that iPhone gross margins tend to be lower early in the new product
   cycle and improve late. If more buyers are selecting the Plus and
   larger memory configurations, Apple might surprise Wall Street there.

   What next?

   Less immediately clear is what happens with the older products Apple
   sells. Last year’s 5s, for example, was estimated at $195 and there are
   some obvious places where Apple is saving now on building it (memory,
   processor, camera). But those amount to perhaps a bit more than $10
   overall. The phone price has obviously fallen by $100, however. Even if
   you account for non-obvious improvements in component costs, the way
   this is possible isn’t readily clear from simply looking at the bill of
   materials.

   And that leads us to an important caveat about IHS’ numbers: They don’t
   include a true accounting of the engineering, capital expenditures, et
   al. that goes into making an iPhone. Apple’s continued use of the
   chassis from the iPhone 5, for example, means that assembly partner
   Foxconn has now become quite adept at building that model and using the
   special equipment purpose built to put it together. The total
   accounting cost of building a 5s is higher than it might appear just
   looking at the IHS data, but the gap between one of those and the
   iPhone 6 is doubtless larger.
