   [42]Zack O'Malley Greenburg here, thanks for reading! I'm a senior
   editor at Forbes, where I cover the business of music & entertainment.
   I'm author of [43]Empire State of Mind: How Jay-Z Went From Street
   Corner To Corner Office; my second book, the business biography
   [44]Michael Jackson, Inc, was published by Simon & Schuster in 2014. At
   my day job, I pen [45]The Beat Report, which gives readers an inside
   look at the intersection of my two specialties, business and music.
   Over the past five years, I've investigated topics from [46]Wu Tang
   Clan's secret album in Morocco to the return of tourism in
   post-conflict [47]Sierra Leone to the earning power of [48]Hip-Hop Cash
   Kings like [49]Diddy and [50]Jay-Z, interviewing personalities from
   [51]Toby Keith to [52]Justin Bieber in the process. In addition to
   Forbes, where I started as a summer intern in 2005, my work has also
   appeared in [53]The Washington Post, [54]Billboard, [55]Sports
   Illustrated, [56]Vibe, [57]Hollywood Reporter,
   [58]McSweeney's and others. For more, check out [59]my website and

Cash Kings 2014: The World's Highest-Paid Hip-Hop Acts

   [71]Hip-Hop Cash Kings 2014

   Earlier this year [72]Apple [73]Apple shelled out $3 billion to
   purchase Beats, the company founded by Jimmy Iovine and [74]Dr. Dre.
   Though the latter quickly claimed to be hip-hop’s first billionaire, a
   nine-figure tax bill means that won’t happen immediately—but he’s well
   on his way.

   In the meantime, Dre has been racking up plenty of other financial
   accomplishments. His latest: capturing this year’s hip-hop cash crown
   with pretax earnings of $620 million. Not only is that the highest
   annual total of any entertainer ever evaluated by FORBES, it’s more
   than the combined earnings of all 24 of his companions on the 2014
   Hip-Hop Cash Kings list.

   “It’s safe to say headphones is a good business,” says DJ Khaled, who
   makes his debut at No. 20 with estimated earnings of $7 million.

   [75]Full coverage: Hip-Hop Cash Kings 2014

   It’s a long way down to the No. 2 spot, where Diddy and Jay Z sit tied
   at $60 million. Hov’s total is his highest since 2010, bolstered by a
   diverse list of ventures including his growing Roc Nation [76]empire
   [77]empire; 68 concerts in our scoring period, D’Ussé cognac and his
   latest album, which was certified platinum before it was released due
   to an agreement with Samsung to buy 1 million copies.

   Like Jay Z, Diddy is still working as hard as ever to earn his $60
   million payday. His agreement with [78]Diageo&#039;s [79]Diageo&#039;s
   Ciroc vodka accounts for the bulk of those bucks, but he gets a boost
   from other ventures like DeLeon tequila, Blue Flame marketing, Sean
   Jean clothing, and Revolt TV.

   “I love going where the hustle is,” he [80]told FORBES earlier this
   year. “I love going where like-minded people are.”

   One person who could be counted in that category is Drake, who ranks
   fourth with $33 million in earnings. His fourth studio album, Nothing
   Was the Same, has sold about 4 million copies worldwide; additional
   checks from an arena tour and endorsement deal with Nike’s Jordan line
   have tripled Drake’s 2013 earnings of $10.5 million.

   Macklemore & Ryan Lewis round out the top five with a combined $32
   million. The Seattle duo kicked off 2014 with a bang, winning four of
   the seven Grammy awards for which they were nominated—including Best
   New Artist and Best Rap Album for The Heist. That type of acclaim has
   translated to big bucks on the road, pushing the pair to more than
   triple last year’s $9 million take.

   To form this year’s Cash Kings list, we considered income from touring,
   record sales, publishing, merchandise sales, endorsements and other
   ventures. [81]Management, agent and attorney fees are not deducted.
   Earnings are calculated from June 2013 to June 2014 and based on data
   from Pollstar, the RIAA and Nielsen SoundScan, and from interviews with
   managers, lawyers, executives and some of the artists themselves.

   Another highlight of the list: the inclusion of two newcomers, DJ
   Khaled and J. Cole, who are tied for No. 20 with earnings of $7
   million. New albums in 2013—Cole’s Born Sinner and Khaled’s Suffering
   From Success—and the live gigs that followed boosted both artists to
   the greatest financial heights of their respective careers.

   “It worked out even better than I imagined,” [82]said Cole. “And I’ll
   leave it at that.”

   It’s safe to say that’s a sentiment most likely shared by Dr. Dre.

   Jackson, Inc and my Jay Z biography [84]Empire State of Mind. You can
