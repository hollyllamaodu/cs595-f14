   Dan Gilbert, author of "Stumbling on Happiness," challenges the idea
   that we’ll be miserable if we don’t get what we want. Our
   "psychological immune system" lets us feel truly happy even when things
   don’t go as planned.

   [94]Dan Gilbert
   Psychologist; happiness expert
   Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says our beliefs about what will make
   us happy are often wrong — a premise he supports with intriguing
   research, and explains in his accessible and unexpectedly funny book,
   Stumbling on Happiness. [95]Full bio
