6 Small Money Moves That Can Have A Big Impact On Your Nest Egg

   By Jane Bianchi

   This post originally appeared on [54]LearnVest.

   Saving for retirement doesn’t happen in one fell swoop.

   It usually starts with baby steps: First you might enroll in a 401(k)
   or set up an IRA. Next it’s time to take advantage of any employer
   match available to you. And then you should seriously think about
   increasing your contributions periodically.

   If you’ve taken some of these steps, congratulations—you’re ahead of
   the curve!

   According to a recent [55]Bankrate survey, nearly 40% of Americans
   haven’t even started saving for retirement. And the numbers don’t get
   much more encouraging with age: More than a quarter of those ages 50 to
   64 admit to the fact that they don’t have a nest egg.

   But starting to save is half the battle—there are other steps to
   consider taking to help maximize your retirement strategy and make
   every penny count.

   That’s why we’ve rounded up six small, retirement-focused moves you can
   do today that could help build your nest egg savings down the line.
   Translation: Not only might these ideas help you save more, but they
   may also help you save smarter.

   small moves boost save more retirement

   Small Move #1: Seek Out Low Expense Ratios

   An expense ratio is a fancy name for the fee you pay when you invest in
   a mutual fund or ETF. It’s essentially the percentage of assets that a
   fund charges to cover its administrative and management costs.

   And the more “actively” your account is managed—i.e., there is a person
   or team who is making trades to potentially boost your return—the
   higher that percentage tends to be. If your account is “passively”
   managed, meaning that it’s likely mirroring an index, like the S&P 500,
   it won’t usually require active trading. Therefore, your fee will
   likely be lower.

   Expense ratios are seemingly small—they typically range anywhere from
   less than 1% to 2%—but they can have an impact on your investments in
   the long run.

   Say you’ve invested $10,000 in a fund that has a 6% annual return and
   an expense ratio of 1.5%. In 25 years, that fee has cost you $13,339 in
   returns. By contrast, if that account had an expense ratio of 0.5%
   instead, that number goes down to $5,031. (Check out this [56]Vanguard
   graphic for more on how expense ratios could affect your returns.)

   The bottom line: “[Your expense ratio] should be below 1%. If it’s
   above that, consider looking at competitors to find a better deal,”
   says David Blaylock, CFP® with [57]LearnVest Planning Services. “There
   are probably lower-cost alternatives that achieve the same investment
   objectives.”

   If you’re not sure what your expense ratio is, call your provider to
   double check or read through your prospectus, which should have the
   details. Many companies make it hard to find, but legally, they must
   share their fee information.
   And if you have a 401(k), switching providers may be harder because
   you’re limited to who your company uses. But you can at least talk to
   your human resources department about the possibility of finding one
   that offers lower-fee funds.

   good.

   Small Move #2: Look Into Auto-Escalating Your Retirement Savings

   Many experienced savers already take a “path of least resistance”
   approach to their retirement contributions by having a set percentage
   of their salary deducted from their paychecks and diverted to a 401(k).

   This type of automation helps keep you from spending your retirement
   money, but it still leaves the job of increasing your savings up to
   you—a task that often falls to the priority wayside.

   Luckily, “plans are beginning to add an auto-escalation feature, which
   can even coincide with your employer’s review cycle,” says Peter
   Macaluso, vice president of [60]FM International, a retirement services
   company. “So when you’re due for a raise of 2% to 4%, you can
   auto-escalate your 401(k) deferrals by 1% or so at the same time. It’s
   a way to save more without feeling it in your pocket.” In fact, one
   study found that auto-escalation alone helped boost savings for some
   workers by [61]up to 28%.

   If your company doesn’t offer an auto-escalation feature, or if you
   contribute to an IRA instead of a 401(k), consider setting a periodic
   calendar alert (once every six months might be a good frequency) to
   remind yourself to review your contributions and see how much you can
   afford to boost your contributions.

   Small Move #3: Roll Over Old Retirement Accounts

   Whenever you start a new job, you’re likely also enrolling in a new
   401(k) plan. And, for many people, that often means juggling two,
   three, four or more accounts at any given time.

   Keeping separate 401(k) accounts can be annoying for two reasons.
   First, from an organizational standpoint, you have multiple sets of
   paperwork, online passwords and account balances to track. There’s also
   the fact that leaving your money in an old 401(k) means that you may
   not be in the loop on changes that a previous employer may have made to
   a plan since you left the company.

   RELATED: [62]IRS Changes the Rules for Rollovers

   Second, if you keep separate accounts, you’re also paying separate
   fees. You’re being charged administrative fees for each account on top
   of the aforementioned expense ratios—costs that can eat into your
   returns. “Even if [your administrative fees] are just $30 or $40 per
   year, that’s still something,” Blaylock says. “Plus, you can monitor
   your investments more closely if they are consolidated in one place.”

   So consider saving yourself some trouble by rolling everything into a
   single 401(k) account. Just be sure to do your homework on whether it’s
   better for you to roll over your old 401(k)s into your current one, or
   roll old balances into a single IRA—because a recent [63]government
   report revealed that plan providers aren’t always up front about all of
   the options best suited for you.

   Small Move #4: Find “Areas of Opportunity” in Your Budget

   Keeping close tabs on your spending history can be useful for locating
   what Blaylock calls “areas of opportunity” for cutting back. Once
   you’ve pinpointed costs that can be trimmed, you can then consider
   transferring those savings into your retirement account.

   If you don’t already, track your spending for about three months—or
   however long it might take to get a clear picture of your money—by
   using a spreadsheet, closely monitoring your credit card and bank
   statements, or by starting a free [64]LearnVest.com account, which can
   track your spending for you.

   Were there particular months when you went over budget or your spending
   seemed higher than usual? Next, review your transactions during those
   high-spending months to see if there’s a particular cost you could cut
   back on. Maybe there’s a recurring bill you can live without, such as a
   subscription service, or perhaps you’d be willing to cut back on dining
   out or entertainment.
   “Is there something you don’t enjoy or use often?” Blaylock asks. “For
   example, my house alarm [service] is something I haven’t used in years.
   So, at one point, I asked myself, ‘Why am I still doing this?’ ”

   Once you’ve isolated your own “areas of opportunity,” ask yourself:
   What is a need versus a want? Then see which “wants” you can eliminate,
   and consider putting that extra savings toward retirement. “Almost
   anyone can look at their budgets and try to find at least $50 extra per
   month,” Blaylock says.

   Small Move #5: Adopt the Buddy System

   Need extra motivation to push you to save smarter? This is where having
   some accountability can help.

   Maybe you’re procrastinating rolling over your 401(k). Or perhaps
   you’ve been meaning to check your retirement portfolio to decide if you
   need to rebalance.

   In the same way that a gym buddy can push you to do more reps, a money
   buddy—in the form of a friend, family member or financial adviser—can
   challenge you to be better with your finances, help you meet deadlines
   or just give you that extra shoulder tap to get a task done.

   Instead of building fitness, you’re building your retirement-savings
   muscle.

   Small Move #6: Play a Little “Catch Up”

   Here’s one sweet benefit to getting older: If you’re at least 50, you
   can take advantage of catch-up retirement contributions—up to $5,500 to
   your 401(k) or $1,000 to your IRA (as of 2014)—over and above the
   standard contribution limits.

   “The timing [of catch-up contributions] for a lot of people is great
   because, at that age, your kids are typically done with or almost done
   with college and you likely have more discretionary income,” says Bill
   Losey, CFP® and author of [65]Retire in a Weekend. “Those catch-up
   contributions can make a substantial difference.”

   And remember that no matter how old you are, you’re not limited to
   keeping just one type of retirement account. Indeed, you may have to
   contribute to more than one in order to meet your retirement goals,
   especially if you started saving later in life.

   So if you max out your 401(k) every year and can afford to save more,
   check to see if you qualify to contribute to a Roth or Traditional
   IRA [66]here. Or, you can consider opening a brokerage account to help
   make additional savings contributions.
