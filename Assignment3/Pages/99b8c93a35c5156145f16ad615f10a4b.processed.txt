European River Cruises To Honor WWI

   [45]Comment Now
   [46]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   This past summer marked the 100th anniversary of the onset of the First
   World War, and to commemorate the centennial, [47]CroisiEurope is
   offering [48]three river cruises in 2015 that will travel through
   France and Belgium and tour historically significant sites.

   “The war to end all wars,” the European river cruise operator noted
   when it announced the new cruises, “redrew boundaries, reshaped the
   political landscape and forever changed the way wars were fought.”

   More than nine million soldiers and seven million civilians died from
   1914-1918, making the Great War one of the deadliest conflicts in human
   history, according to the [49]National World War I Museum at Liberty
   Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri.

   During the onshore excursions, guests will be able to get an up-close
   look at historic areas and explore the war’s impact during visits and
   tours to memorials, battlefields, museums and take part in other
   cultural immersion experiences that pay homage to the war.

   During [50]A Great War – A Commemorative Cruise (Ostend to Lille),
   guests spend seven days exploring the historic sites of Belgium and
   France, which include a walk through the “Trench of Death” in
   Diksmuide, a visit to what is described as the largest memorial for
   commonwealth forces, the Memorial to the Missing in Kotrijik and a tour
   of the underground tunnels used during the war at the Carrière
   Wellington. Prices begin at $1,809 per person for travel on September
   10, 2015.

   [51]A Great War – A Commemorative Cruise (Lille to Ostend): This
   journey begins in France with tours of the historic cities of Lille and
   Comines. From there, guests will discover the Memorial of the Missing,
   the Passchendaele Museum, Yser Tower Memorial and attend the Last Post
   Ceremony before ending the trip in Ostend. Prices for this 7-day cruise
   begin at $1,809 per person for travel September 16, 2015.

   [52]The Great War – Cruise on a Hotel Barge in Champagne: This
   seven-day cruise aboard one of CroisiEurope’s new barge ships combines
   historical significance with local culture. Beginning in Paris,
   cruisers take in battlefields, museums and memorials dotting the Marne
   before enjoying champagne tastings in Chalons-en-Champagne. Prices
   begin at $2,781 per person on May 28, 2015, July 8, 2015 and September
   17, 2015.
