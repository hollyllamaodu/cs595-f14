How To Keep Lifestyle Inflation From Sabotaging Your Finances

   By Marisa Torrieri

   This post originally appeared on [54]LearnVest.

   Margo Schlossberg never considered herself to be much of an indulgent
   spender.

   Even though there was plenty of opportunity to splurge on fine dining
   and high-end beauty treatments in the upper-middle-class Washington,
   D.C., suburb of Reston, Va., where she lives, she never felt
   particularly tempted to partake.

   That is, until the 44-year-old marketing professional landed a hefty
   raise that made her paycheck fatter by $2,000 more per month—which had
   an almost immediate effect on her spending.

   “I started indulging more in the little things,” Schlossberg says. “I
   got more manicures and pedicures, went out to eat a lot more and
   splurged on fancy drinks.” On top of that, she took a pricey dream trip
   to Sri Lanka.

   Schlossberg’s rationale? Her workload had doubled and she was putting
   in an intense, ten-hour workday while also enduring a taxing, two-hour
   commute. So she felt deserving of the good life—or at least a better
   one.

   While Schlossberg’s newfound spending didn’t put her in the poorhouse,
   it didn’t get her ahead, either. Her savings often fluctuated due to
   her splurging, and she never took the time to rejigger her budget to
   see how her added income could be put to better use. “I didn’t run into
   money trouble, but I should have known better,” she says. “But, hey,
   I’m human.”

   Sound familiar?

   Schlossberg certainly isn’t the only person guilty of using a raise as
   an excuse to bump up her spending. In fact, there’s a popular term for
   this common story line: lifestyle inflation, or the idea that as you
   make more, you spend more.

   This, in turn, can make you feel a bit like a hamster on a wheel when
   it comes to your money: You have to keep running at full speed just to
   keep up with your new bills and satisfy your spending urges—without
   making any progress on your financial goals.

   lifestyle inflation

   The Social Psychology Behind Lifestyle Inflation

   Numerous studies support the notion that as incomes rise, so does the
   tendency to spend, not save. A [55]Federal Reserve report found, for
   instance, that less than half of Americans earning between $75,000 and
   $99,999 saved any money whatsoever—and as many as 16% of those within
   that income bracket actually went into debt.

   At the same time, a recent [56]Brookings Institute study found that
   families stuck living paycheck to paycheck are actually twice as likely
   to be solidly middle class than low-income. The authors dubbed this
   demo the “wealthy hand to mouth,” a group that tends to be older,
   educated and high-earning—and yet can’t seem to get ahead.

   So why, despite our best intentions, do we often end up putting our
   raises toward a bigger apartment or luxury SUV before we tackle our
   savings goals?
   For starters, we’re conditioned to always be on the hunt for more.
   Psychologists refer to this as the “[57]hedonic treadmill,” or our
   instinctive desire for bigger, better comforts every chance we get.

   “It’s human nature to want to improve one’s economic and social
   standing—whether that’s upgrading housing, clothing or toys,” says Brad
   Klontz, a CFP® and financial psychologist. “If it wasn’t, we would all
   still be living outdoors wearing animal skins.”

   The difference is that today, instead of being spurred by survival of
   the fittest, we’re driven by the “[58]Keeping Up With the Joneses”
   effect. It’s the need to purchase items—often beyond our means—to show
   we’re doing at least as well as, if not better than, our neighbors.

   And the effect of this one-upmanship shouldn’t be taken lightly:
   One [59]2010 study concluded that people tend to be happier when they
   have more money—but only if it gives them the perception of being
   better off than friends and peers.

   “Many of our spending decisions are made by our unconscious brains,
   which equate social standing with life or death,” explains Klontz. “And
   the further we drift from the norm in our social group, the more
   anxiety we feel.” Translation: Seeing that shiny new car in a
   neighbor’s driveway cues our brain to think that our social standing is
   being threatened—spurring us to spend as soon as we have the resources.

   There’s also the entitlement factor, which Klontz calls the “I work
   hard, so I deserve to buy nice things” script. “While it’s true that it
   is nice to have your hard work reinforced with some indulgence, it
   should not come at the expense of thoughtful financial planning,” he
   says. “Ironically, although this belief feels like wealth in the
   moment, it actually perpetuates a feeling of lack.”

   So while there’s nothing wrong with rewarding yourself for your hard
   work, one of the dangers of this behavior is becoming used to a new,
   more expensive normal—thus unraveling any previous discipline you may
   have built into your budget. Just ask Schlossberg. “It’s like when
   someone goes on a diet, loses weight and then can eat again,” she says.
   “Those luxuries soon become mandatory parts of your life.”

   Living the Good Life: How to Keep Lifestyle Inflation in Check

   Many of us fantasize about what we’d do if we got a big pay bump—and
   more often than not, it usually entails picturing ourselves unwinding
   for a week in Bora Bora, buying a second home in the country or finally
   get that sporty car.

   But it’s also common to feel like a higher salary means you can
   automatically take on higher recurring expenses—whether it’s swapping
   out basic cable for a premium package, or moving from a one-bedroom to
   a two-bedroom apartment.

   David Blaylock, a CFP® with [60]LearnVest Planning Services, sees the
   damaging effects of lifestyle inflation all too often. “People need to
   be cautious with raises and long-term changes,” he says. “If you want
   to eat out a little extra, that’s fine. But if you want to take on a
   [higher] car payment, that’s a whole other thing that you need to
   carefully consider—and budget for, regardless of your income.”

   And then there’s what Ashley Feinstein, a New York City–based money
   coach, calls the “CVS/Duane Reade effect,” or the tendency to feel like
   you don’t need to track day-to-day little buys now that you’re reeling
   in more. Three-times-a-week sushi lunches? Sure! Treats for the kids
   each and every time you go to the store? Why not!

   And Feinstein should know—much of the five-figure bonuses she used to
   rake in as an investment banker slipped through her fingers on
   impromptu, and seemingly minor, purchases.

   “It wasn’t really any one thing, [the money] just sort of trickled
   away,” she says. “One day, I realized, ‘I don’t like this job, but I
   can’t afford to leave because I don’t have any substantial savings.’ ”

   But while the stress of working harder, societal pressures and the lure
   of shiny new toys all may seem to be conspiring against you,
   it is possible to deflate lifestyle inflation—and it can boil down to
   four money to-dos.

   1. Keep financial goals at the top of your priority list. Whenever you
   get a raise, you’re more likely to think, “Hawaii, here we come!”
   rather than, “Hey, I get to save more for retirement!” Before you know
   it, you’ve mentally diverted that 3% raise to a 3% hike in dining out,
   your shopping budget and your travel spending.
   People with high incomes often fall into this trap because they already
   have some money in retirement and emergency savings, says Blaylock, “so
   they don’t feel the need to increase working on financial goals since
   they’re already somewhat covered, and any extra earnings is viewed as
   ‘fun money.’ ”

   But an uptick in income can be a prime time to rethink your nest egg,
   especially since your retirement goal is often pegged to a percentage
   of your pay. A general rule of thumb is to aim to replace about 85% of
   your current income in retirement—which means you’ll need to sock away
   more toward retirement with each pay increase.

   For this reason, consider upping your retirement contributions by the
   same percentage as your raise—so if your income increased by 5%, so
   should your retirement contributions.

   The same goes for your rainy day fund because your emergency savings
   target is tied to whatever your take-home pay is at the time. “If you
   now have less than six months of your new income, you probably don’t
   have enough,” Blaylock says. “So a portion of that new raise should go
   toward building that fund up more.”

   Generally, Blaylock recommends trying to earmark at least 50% of each
   pay raise toward financial goals—whether it’s retirement, emergency
   savings, paying off your credit card debt, or socking away more for a
   big savings goal.

   2. Remind yourself that your budget—and goals—aren’t the same as that
   of your friend. It may make you green with envy when you hear about
   your best buddy’s yearly trip to the French Riviera, but her vacation
   doesn’t have to be yours—and it may not be in your budget’s best
   interest anyway.

   Remember that your big-ticket goals are uniquely yours, which means
   your savings strategy should be dependent on your budget and
   timetable—not societal pressures or competition.

   But if you do want your friends’ experiences to be your own, consider
   working on a goal together, like a group getaway that you all take
   every few years. You may build stronger bonds by checking in on one
   another’s progress—and you may even find that you’ve become good money
   influences on each other.

   3. Test-drive some of your lifestyle upgrades. If you’ve already
   covered your basic financial security and want to indulge in some
   lifestyle changes, consider trying before you buy by predetermining one
   or two upgrades that would bring you the most joy. Then do some
   comparison shopping to see what a reasonable cost is for such
   upgrades, and determine how those new expenses would impact your
   budget.

   “For example, try pretending that you have a bigger mortgage payment
   and put that additional money into a savings account for a few months
   to see if it’s something you can live with,” Blaylock suggests. And if
   it turns out that you can’t live without that extra money, you’ve at
   least increased your savings.

   4. Bake in some “me” money. Of course, it would be unrealistic to say
   that every dollar from a raise should go toward savings. “If you’re
   making an extra $1,000 a month, think about putting $100 back into
   lifestyle, if it works for your budget,” suggests Blaylock. “We do need
   to do something to reward ourselves.”

   And remember that your flexible expenses—things like eating out,
   groceries and drugstore purchases—are precisely that, flexible. As long
   as you know what your [61]one number is for these types of purchases,
   you have the freedom to spend that money however you’d like.

   For instance, you can treat yourself to a fancy spa day one month, but
   perhaps the next month you take it easy with a less-glamorous, but
   equally fulfilling, dinner out. Just make sure that you recognize when
   you’re spending to give yourself a well-deserved treat, versus when
   you’re doing it in reaction to an emotional state—like going shopping
   to make yourself feel better after a huge fight with your significant
   other.

   Bottom line: It’s perfectly O.K. to reap the benefits of your raise,
   but those lifestyle upgrades also have to be backed up with a rehashed
   budget and simultaneous upgrades to your financial security.

   Schlossberg finally realized this when she watched a friend go through
   a layoff—and it dawned on her that her own hefty paycheck might not be
   endless. So Schlossberg buckled down three months ago and created a
   realistic budget—pinpointing luxuries she could actually afford, while
   also socking away more into her emergency fund.

   “You can’t assume you’re going to stay healthy or keep your job
   forever,” she says. “Living with lifestyle inflation caused a lot of
   stress.”
