Inside The Numbers: The Relatively 'Slow' Growth of Apple's iOS 8

   [49]Comment Now
   [50]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   In an absolute sense, the rapid uptake of Apple’s iOS 8 argues that
   it’s a huge hit. Fiksu pegs usage at 1 in 4 iOS devices, as [51]Ewan
   Spence reports here at Forbes. Using a different methodology, Mixpanel
   suggests the total is closing on 1 in 3, as the chart above indicates.
   But by Apple standards, that’s a far cry from how quickly people rushed
   to pick up iOS 7 last year. At the 5 day mark, both firms had adoption
   running at close to half of all active iOS devices. Are people
   [52]following the advice I suggested last week and simply not rushing
   or is there more to the story?

   By the numbers

   The first thing to realize is that in an absolute sense, the number of
   upgraders isn’t as different as the percentages might indicate. To
   date, about 570 million iPhones have been sold. And of those, about 165
   million were purchased in the past year alone. When last year the
   percentage of users running iOS 7 reached 50%, that represented at most
   about 160 million iPhones (extrapolating the total from Horace Dediu’s
   [53]data at Asymco). This time around, even 25% of the perhaps 440
   million iPhones still running would equal 110 million and 30% would
   represent more than 130 million. That’s fewer people rushing to
   upgrade, but not by much.

   Another interesting data point is that Apple’s own figures indicate
   that among App Store users, 46% of devices are already running iOS 8.
   In other words, the people who are on their iPhones and iPads most
   often, most likely receiving automatic downloads of new apps, are
   upgrading to the new OS rather quickly.

   If not, why not?

   That said, the relatively slower uptake (and the basis of the headline)
   has its roots in the minds of real-world users too. Talking to some of
   them at the iPhone 6 launch, one obvious reason for delaying was an
   intention to buy a new iPhone. While the first-weekend sales of 10
   million might have seemed to be only a small increase from last year’s
   9 million, Chuck Jones here at Forbes can tell you [54]why that’s not
   really the case. In the sense that people didn’t upgrade because they
   planned to buy new, that’s clearly good news for Apple.

   On the other hand, people struggling to upgrade isn’t. A lot of people
   learned quickly that without several gigabytes of free space, they
   couldn’t make the upgrade happen. It’s confusing as to why, but the
   short answer is that the relatively small download (about 1.1 GB) is
   compressed and while it’s installing, it not only expands, but also
   needs some “working room” to put itself into place without disturbing
   your old installation until it’s done. If you can’t free up space but
   have access to a PC or Mac with iTunes, make a backup and install it
   that. iMore has a guide to [55]walk you through. Apple has sold a small
   but meaningful number of 8GB iPhone 5c models in the past year and will
   continue to do so for the next year. Getting a new OS on one of those
   if it’s not already there will be challenging without a computer
   nearby.

   Ironically, another reason some users cited for delaying the upgrade
   was that they didn’t see much exciting in the OS. The visual overhaul
   of iOS 7 drew a great deal of attention from users despite
   significantly less under the hood than iOS 8 offers. In my “[56]A Guide
   To What’s Great In iOS 8,” I offer a rundown of some of the best new
   features and Amadou Diallo does similarly, [57]with a focus on photos.
   There’s much more this year than meets the eye.

   Bugs but no showstoppers

   But beyond the install issues and some user indifference, there have
   been the typical bugs with any major overhaul. Gordon Kelly details
   some reports of [58]WiFi and battery issues. And it’s worth noting that
   not a single iOS release has come and gone without at least some users
   reporting some troubles with battery life. Often these get resolved in
   a x.0.1 update and frequently the trouble is with specific apps.

   In my time with the release version of iOS 8, I’m finding the
   experience more bug-ridden than the beta. The reason is almost
   certainly that as apps are reaching the public, they’re the culprit
   (during the beta, most iOS 8-enabled apps weren’t available for
   testing). Third-party keyboards, one of the most powerful features in
   the new OS, often lead to strange behavior like the keyboard simply
   disappearing from the screen in Apple’s Messages app. The solution I’ve
   been using is to double-click the Home button, swipe the app away to
   close it and then re-open it. At that point, all is normal again, but
   it’s obviously inconvenient.

   Another small but apparent bug is Safari refuses to save the setting by
   which I can have LastPass (a password manager) appear on the “share”
   screen as an option next to the bookmark button. It keeps scooting its
   way back to the far right, where it’s hidden. That bug appears to be
   Safari’s fault, but who’s to say at this point?

   None of thees issues are showstoppers, but any time you hear from a
   friend or colleague about trouble with an upgrade, you’re perhaps a bit
   more likely to hold off for a few days or weeks. Certainly if you do
   that in this case, there’s no harm. iOS 8 isn’t going anywhere and apps
   are only likely to become more compatible as time passes.

   Lessons for Apple?

   Looking ahead, Apple is probably well served to be more proactive in
   the future. It has done a great job this year — and really every year —
   of producing a high-quality OS upgrade that tens of millions can
   download and run within days of release. That consistency of version
   allows developers to trust that they can write for iOS 8 and most users
   will be on it soon enough. But as the company continues to ship 8GB and
   even 16GB phones, while still having more than 100 million in the wild
   that are likely to be receiving upgrades in the future, it can do more
   to both facilitate and to educate.

   With some creative tweaking to the way iCloud works, it could act as a
   stand-in for having to revert to iTunes backups, albeit a bit more
   slowly. And Apple could at the very least take responsibility for
   explaining how to make iTunes backups happen. Perhaps it could even
   help users with iPads that have free space use those to upgrade iPhones
   and vice versa.
   As for bugs, they’re a fact of life on all this. Because iOS 8 opens up
   the internals of Apple’s software to Extensions that allow for password
   managers, keyboards and more sharing options, things were bound to
   break in new ways. That should get better over time. But it’s also
   likely Apple will continue tweaking how much those Extensions are
   allowed to do and continue opening up additional third-party
   functionality as it did this year with TouchID (and will likely next
   year with the new NFC chip in the iPhone 6). The company opened up the
   Mac OS X beta to the public this year and, as a result, got a much
   larger testing pool. It could be time to do the same with iOS.
