   Hi I'm comedian Aziz Ansari. I'm working on a book about modern romance
   and wanted to reach out to the reddit community to share their
   experiences. I've read and been told many interesting stories that I
   will be commenting on here. I'll be joined by NYU professor Eric
   Klinenberg (ericklinenberg), the author of Going Solo, who's working
   with me on the book. Thanks for your time.

   Eric and I have been doing interviews and focus groups on modern
   romance all over the US and in some other countries, too. We'd like to
   use your comments here the way we use what we learn in our other
   conversations. So any and all stories posted here may be used in our
   book.

   One more thing: I'm a comedian, so please do not mistake anything you
   read here as professional advice.

   [124]Teenagers: What are the positive and negative effects that social
   media has on your social life? ([125]self.modernromantics)

   submitted 1 month ago * by [126]azizansariAMA

   We've read about some negatives, like girls feeling pressure to post
   provocative images, public shaming/bullying, guys being very sexually
   aggressive on chat, and the like. We've also heard positives, like how
   it is helping shy people make connections and expand their social
   horizons beyond your school. What is your experience?

   Has anyone gotten off or never been on social media and then felt left
   out because of it?

   Is there anyone to "like" someone's photos and not be showing romantic
   interest? A few people mentioned below that it basically means you are
   interested if you "like" a photo.

   Ok, so, liking a photo is fine. As long as it has been posted in the
   last 48 hours. Some girls think that of a guy likes their photo, then
   they're in love with them. Now, guys do this too, but not as often.

   The time limit is a weird thing though. If you like a picture that
   someone posted last week, it means you've been snooping around their
   profile. That can hint at the other person. If you like a photo that
   has been posted in the last 24-48 hours, it's not that surprising and
   most people don't take note of it.

   Pretty much, if you go through and like every one of someone's profile
   pictures, they're going to a) think you're into them and b) possibly
   find you creepy.

   Sometimes I like a photo because it's funny, nice, or the person looks
   good in it. It's not necessarily a romantic interest for me. And
   sometimes I just like a photo to boost someone's confidence because
   some teens I know are pretty disheartened if they don't reach their set
   goal of likes.

   Yeah. I've seen some people post another picture asking to get more
   likes on a previously posted one. Honestly it's kinda sad, because
   sometimes I feel people put their social media life before their real
   one. And it's crazy and hard to believe that some people even do that.
   It's like they're living two lifes.

   on facebook liking photos is fine, even expected, and doesn't matter if
   you barely know the person. on instagram, if you're a guy, you
   definitely think she's attracted and are interested.

   I have to say, it's very American to think that. In France, we
   sometimes like a girl's pic ironically. As we actually make fun of the
   fact that she's trying to be über attractive on her pic. Seems that
   American people are more true about this.

   I would love to quit Facebook cause I feel like it's had negative
   effects on my life (it's really hard to get over someone when you're
   seeing them tagged in pics with all your friends constantly, snooping
   parents, addiction and idolatry, etc) but my friends who don't have FB
   miss events so often cause they aren't part of groups or whatever. And
   I'm also kind of worried I'll miss out on someone trying to reach out
   to me, although that's never really happened before.

   tldr: it's primary source of communication in some circles

   I did remove facebook from my phone and bookmarks on my computer,
   keeping messenger for the ease of getting a hold of someone. I check
   the website every other week only to see my notifications (invited to
   events, etc.)

   It made me happier, made me keep in contact with my friends better and
   I am not checking phone as often.

   Also manually deleted every status update and picture upload since
   2008, felt like Facebook removed a lot of the pleasure of getting to
   know someone if you can read their thoughts and see their pictures from
   the past 6 years.

   Did give me a boost in confidence as I felt less weight down by my past
   but the greatest victory is not having your parents know everything
   going on in your life.

   there are some occasions where a twitter fight or funny picture leaks
   on twitter and the one kid that doesn't have an account didn't see, but
   usually someone shows him. people who don't have accounts usually don't

   Recently I deactivated my Facebook page for a few weeks and after I did
   it I realized that I was getting left out of certain things. I don't
   think it was intentional by any means, but people just assume that all
   of their friends are on social media so when they create an event they
   always do it on Facebook and they just tell people about it through
   Facebook. And if someone doesn't have a Facebook page they are sort-of
   lost in the inviting process (unless you're very good friends with
   them). At least around my age group (21 male). And I must admit I'm
   guilty of it myself. When on Facebook and I'm going to have a party
   I'll just create a Facebook event and invite people through Facebook
   due to the sheer ease of the process and I'll often forget that some
   friends aren't on social media and I inadvertently do not invite them.

   I've joined Twitter only recently because a majority of my school's
   population have Twitter accounts. They would often reference trending
   jokes/topics from the previous evening and I felt sorta' left out and
   it motivated me to join all the fun.

   Most teenagers today organize parties/events through Facebook nowadays.
   One of my friends who removed herself from social media is left out of
   a lot of parties, simply just because people scroll down their friends
   list when inviting people and unless they're particularly close with
   her, she gets overlooked

   I quit Facebook a few years ago when I moved states for college and a
   job. The govt job didn't require me to get rid of it but I didn't like
   Facebook and the knowing about people I didn't like. It was a bit rough
   moving to a new place and breaking contact for the first few months.
   After six months or so, the feeling went away and k starting meeting
   new people. It is kind of fulfilling to go my own way and know for a
   certaintity I can't screw up by saying where I work or what I did that
   day. It is cool though I can say to my dad though, " Can't talk about
   it it's classified."

   It's just annoying to see ignorance. If a person I'm kind of neutral
   about tweets/retweets/shares some misogynistic/racist/sexist b.s, I
   can't really look at them the same way. And sometimes you're forced to
   interact with them at school...

   And it's nice for shy people to be given a platform to actually be
   heard on, but most of the time, it doesn't change their circumstances
   at school/in social situations. Like, you could have a really nice
   conversation with someone you wouldn't necessarily talk to at school
   via Twitter or Facebook, but as soon as you get back to school the next
   day, you probably won't go out of your way to acknowledge them.

   I'm 19 so this question almost doesn't apply to me anymore. First off
   lemme say big fan of yours Aziz. Social media is very much a two sided
   coin, it has its great positives, and low negatives. Positives, it's
   (sort of like you said) helped me expand my horizons beyond just
   school. A lot of my culture and hobbies and preferences are a direct
   result of the Internet, and social media. The music I listen to, the
   comedians I like, TV shows I watch, etc. Things I do in my spare time,
   I don't think I'd ever consider if I didn't have the Internet.
   Negatives, social media has created a very strange generation of
   'awkward teenagers'. A lot of teenagers have two very different
   personas. An online one, and an IRL one. This is something that I think
   has changed about society, and won't ever go back. I remember what life
   was like before I was an avid user of the Internet, I used to watch
   Yu-Gi-Oh! for half an hour, play basketball in my driveway with my
   neighbor, then play video games until 8:30 then go straight to bed.
   Using the Internet was a very rare occurrence for me, and if I ever
   went online it was to look for cheat codes. That was it, and I was just
   me. I look at my younger brother, and other kids his age (early teens),
   and they have this strange thing where they act completely different
   online than they do offline, in person. They don't remember life before
   the internet, and I think that's a big factor. Social media gives kids
   a platform to split their personalities into something they want to
   portray. I mean, why should my younger brother have an Instagram
   account? What does he possibly need to share? The pair of shoes my dad
   bought him to show that he's 'stuntin'? I dunno. Kids are weird. This
   could be a positive, but for me I look at it as a negative. Splitting
   yourself into different personas isn't healthy imo, and it prevents you
   from being a part of society and moving forward with one another. You
   can't participate if you're not being your most you

   [288][–][289]FireButt 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago [290](3

   Positive:
   - I can see what other people are doing, so I can catch up with trends
   and stuff?
   - Makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only one who can't sleep at
   2AM.
   - Social Media is entertaining. I can see two people fight it out, and
   then I can intervene with a solution or make it worse. You have so much
   power over things.
   - You can talk about things you wouldn't say in real life.

   Negatives:
   - People like me more on twitter than in real life.

   Also, thanks for doing this Aziz, I'm a brown kid as well and I can
   relate to a lot of your stuff.

   No one really talks to me. I guess it's because I don't really make an
   effort. If you ask someone in my school about me, they'll probably say,
   "Oh, yeah I've seen him before, he's pretty chill." That's my firsthand
   experience on how I've been described before. "Chill."

   On twitter, I get favorites, and responses. If I were to say something
   witty or funny in class, I would get an awkward silence or a couple of
   laughs. Once someone told me that all teens are awkward in person, and
   if I act awkward too, everyone else will act the same.

   I'm only 20 now, so I think I still qualify. As a teenager who was
   suffering from anxiety and depression, being able to reach out beyond
   the confines of my small high school and find people who understood
   what I was going through and could offer advice was an honest to god
   life saver. I didn't feel like anyone at school understood my
   depression, but my friends 500 and 2000 miles away definitely did. I
   don't know where I would be if I hadn't had the opportunity to "meet"
   other teens struggling with mental illnesses.

   Positive

   I love being able to keep in touch with people. If I want to contact
   anyone it's only a few clicks away.

   It's cool to be able to learn about so many cultures and places and
   things from my bedroom or from my phone. I think it's a really
   important thing that this generation has. All of this information is
   available to us so I instantly.

   Also, everything being so instant is really helpful.

   Negative

   I don't like seeing people post just the most amazing parts of their
   lives because it makes me feel inferior that I'm not doing those
   amazing things (but sadly I know I do the exact same thing).

   Social media makes me feel too attached to things that really shouldn't
   matter. Am I really concerned what one girl had for breakfast or what
   one guy thinks of his math homework? No, I shouldn't be, but I am.

   I feel like another thing that's frustrating about social media is how
   it's super easy to "curate" what you post on social media and craft an
   online persona for yourself, but when people see that persona before
   they get to know you in person, hey can sometimes think you're kind of
   dull or boring compared to your online presence. And like, people get
   so obsessive about getting "likes" and "faves" ! I have friends who
   consider what time they should change their prof pic or tweet something
   to maximize the number of likes that they'll get on it.

   a positive would be that you can keep the relationship on your terms;
   respond to texts when you want, and since you don't see that person
   very often anyway only very few problems occur

   a negative on the sexting- from my and my friends experience more girls
   than you think are willing and enjoy sending pictures. no one really
   thinks its a big deal, rather that it's an expected part of a
   relationship. the problem is that they trust the guy too much and the
   guy will always want to show off the pictures

   another negative is that real life interactions are limited. even when
   you're hanging out with others, trying to be actively social, people
   tend to just go on their phones and go on apps like snapchat and watch
   other people enjoy themselves, which is a backwards way of being
   social. or people will create snapchat stories and instagram accounts
   that make them appear more interesting then they actually are

   Negative: Important, relationship-related conversations occurring over
   text message. Any in-person confrontation now causes anxiety because no
   one is used to having sensitive conversations in person.

   Positive: I once Snapchat-videoed myself drunk-eating a burrito while
   Jurassic Park played in the background. Multiple people told me in
   person the next day that it was the best video they've ever seen. Huge
   social gratification when you are told in person that you are good at
   social media.

   Social media has allowed my peers (on the sites I'm visibly accessible,
   which would exclude tumblr) to gauge what my interests are and who I am
   as a person. A lot of my discussion with friends at school happens to
   revolve around school and I'm not always able to allude to things that
   are a big part of my life/identity. Like retweeting an update from
   Arcade Fire or sharing a post about feminism on facebook says more
   about ME than some tired conversation about a test (I'm not that boring
   though, I swear! That was just an easy example haha). The negative
   aspect to that though is I get this "no one shares my obscure
   interests, every other teen is a vapid zombie", pretentious type of
   thinking that really keeps me further from sharing any of my interests
   with my IRL friends and joining into online communities (fandoms,
   whateveryoucallit) that do- and to the "intense" level that I'm at.
   Which is great and amazing and even the reason why I joined tumblr! But
   it can really affect your relationships with people/how you view your
   friends and you have to be careful to not invest yourself too much into
   the idea that you're the ONLY person within a 50-mile radius that knows
   and cares enough about comedy to make a reddit account in the hopes
   that whatever "insightful" musings you have on social media and your
   generation will be seen by a comedian you spent at least a week's worth
   researching in the summer of 2012.

   I think social media has changed the dynamics of "real life"
   relationships for teenagers, or at least for me. I'm 19, and I think I
   began my downwards spiral into social media when I was in middle
   school. Now I feel sort of obligated to remain on all these sites
   because I feel like I'm going to miss something. But like I mentioned
   above, in terms of the relationships, I've just noticed a few things.
   First, especially on twitter, it's really uncomfortable to realize that
   someone you were/are friends or acquainted with has unfollowed or
   unfriended you, and, at the same time, even though I'm in college now I
   cringe every time I have to unfollow someone that I went to high school
   with even though I haven't talked to them in over a year. I follow
   people that I have absolutely no interest in and don't talk to at all
   just because I feel guilty to unfollow them. It sounds ridiculous but
   this is what I mean, there's like this unwritten etiquette and it's
   terrible. Second, social media has obviously broken down any norms on
   who you talk to, but this is both good and bad in my experience. I met
   some friends, even a few in person from my area on tumblr that shared
   interests with me in high school when I felt all angsty and that
   "nobody understood me" which was really reassuring but at the same time
   nothing is worse than being asked out via facebook message by someone
   you barely know, rejecting them, and then seeing them at school the
   next day. It’s cliché but it really does make it seem like teenagers
   don’t really value human interaction anymore. Social media can be great
   to meet new friends and communicate with current friends, but when it’s
   used to do something you wouldn’t say in real life it’s a major
   problem. And many, not all, teenagers definitely do not understand
   that.

   My SO's best friend moved to India for college. Put simply, it helps
   them keep in contact, and things like retweets about sports on Twitter
   allow for them to keep common ground and have the ability to start
   conversations beyond the old "Hi, how's it going?"s. It's just easier
   to stay in contact with people and keep up with whatever they have
   going on in their lives, which is the reason for it in the first place,

   Social media has been helpful to me in making the arrangement of events
   and get-togethers with my friends, much easier to coordinate. It has
   also helped me in "conversing" with people outside of the regular times
   that I would normally see them.

   The cons of social media are not as prevalent as its pros. Some say it
   makes people less of a participant in face-to-face conversation but in
   my personal experiences, I have had no trouble in channeling the same
   dynamic I have online into the "real world".

   Personally, I've had more positive effects than negative. Lots of
   teenagers use social media as a way to invite people to events that
   they're having, mostly by making a facebook page or sending out a group
   message in the chat. Social media also allows you to see what's going
   on in your area, so you can get a group of your friends together and go
   off to a local show, or a fundraiser in your town. I think it really
   helps bring people together. As far as negative effects go, I have seen
   a fair amount of cyber bullying on social media, because anyone can be
   tough and say anything behind the safety of their computer screen.

   As someone who was a relatively quiet (but friendly) new kid when I was

   I feel like social media has a tendency to take over lives. It's cool
   how it gives you an outlet to talk to people you wouldn't normally talk
   to, like how it's easier to message some guy/girl you're into rather
   than talking to them in person, and a person is more likely to respond
   to you on social media and not feel awk about it as opposed to how
   awkward it would be in real life. BUT it also creates a culture where
   conversations you have when you hang out with someone start to revolve
   around social media, and things you saw on social media. And especially
   with romance, it's like "omg he/she liked my prof pic, does that mean
   he/she's into me?" or like "well it says he/she is single on fb, so are
   they really dating?"

   Since this social media trend, it has never been more difficult to

   history, so much to say about everything. It has become very frustrated
   to actually have a real conversation. You start one, and it's already
   over, cause the person just left you for some other online discussion.

   Also, man, every first comment on any thing posted is negative. Fb,
   twitter, so much criticizing.

   loose connections with acquaintances that you want to have. Like I
   recently just came to school and Ive recognized and spoke with a lot of
   people I've followed on social media since orientation happened.
   However what's annoying about growing up in this era is the expectation
   to follow and keep up with everyone you know. I wish it was more common
   to just follow people whose updates you actually care for. Also many of
   us waste a lot of time on it in weird ways. Being at dinner with
   friends and half of them being on their phones constantly while you're

   Although I'm 20, I still consider myself as a teen. My experience with
   social media has mostly been positive; I've made connections through
   tumblr and twitter, and I've been able to post stupid videos on YouTube
   that apparently made other people smile. Not like I've made a huge
   impact in the world, or anything like that, but it's nice to know that
   not everyone is an asshole whom you see at school every day. Also, I
   was very shy when I was in high school, but being able to express
   myself on tumblr or on YouTube has helped me come out of my shell just
   a tiny bit. The negative effect has mostly been becoming more insecure
   about how I look. I mean, who tells a thirteen year old girl that she
   "looks like a pig" and "should get a nose job"? The level of anonymity
   has made it easier than ever to be as douchey as one wants to be, so
   that can have a negative effect on people who have low self esteem.

   On the positive side: It helps us stay connected with our friends and
   family when we aren't around them, and helps form new relationships.
   It's helps people step out of their comfort zones. On the negative
   side: some teens become too worried about whether people will approve
   of what they post, or how they look on the so called website. Although
   I'm have not experienced it firsthand, some teens are attacked for what
   they believe in and do on a regular daily basis. Some teens let how
   many followers they have or others have and let that define the way the
   judge someone, and that's just silly. Incidents like that cause teens
   to lose self confidence or form insecurities because they are forced
   into the mindset of having to constantly worry about what others think
   of them.Honestly none of that matters, all that really matters is that
   you are enjoying your time and using it to benefit you or others. It's
   as easy as clicking one button to remove those negative people from

   social media does allow us to communicate with people beyond our
   school. i think one of the reasons this is really effective is because
   when a guy and a girl don't see each other that often, but talk
   frequently over text/fb message, rather than getting to know the whole
   real person, you learn just what the other person reveals. also, it
   results in you romanticizing the other person by seeing them free of
   flaws, and more of an escape from real life rather than a component of

   Personally, I've found a lot of positives through having social media
   around through my teenage years (I'm 18 right now). Platforms like
   Twitter and Tumblr have actually really helped to broaden my horizons
   and make me more aware to greater social and political issues around
   the world. While I could have gotten the same sort of education through
   watching the news or reading the New York Times, social media has made
   it so that I could actually learn about these issues from people all
   over the world who have experienced them firsthand. As a result my
   worldview has become unbelievably more broad and open and I think I'm a
   better, more understanding person. As far as negatives go, the only
   social media platform that I've had bad experiences on is Facebook.
   While not every aspect of the site is bad and I've never been tempted
   to post provocative photos because I'm a girl, it's kind of an easy
   place for sexual harassment to take place. In the past I've had to end
   up unfriending people because they wouldn't leave me alone. I'm not
   blaming Facebook as a whole for that because obviously those guys were
   just jackasses, but it really is the only negative thing I've

   I like seeing updates from friends when they post photos or updates.
   It's cool to feel engaged with others when you're remote. But, I think
   it sometimes reduces the incentives to go hang out when you have
   instant access to other people's opinions virtually.

   It feels good to get likes. When I do something and share the
   experience on Instagram, I feel like a pimp rolling in likes. On the
   other hand, it probably isn't healthy to be so focused on other
   people's approval and my experience shouldn't need validation. Also I
   can get jealous of other people doing dope stuff and having fun. In
   reality we're both just trying to make our lives look more baller than
   they are.

   Social media is worth it for Jaden Smith's twitter and Harris'
   Instagram though.

   One weird aspect, not exactly positive or negative, is the way it
   affects relationships. I dated a girl who was adamant against going
   "Facebook official" which I just thought was so silly and how strange
   that would be to people born 100 years ago. Additionally they can

   In terms of the whole experience, social media allows for me to
   maintain relationships with people that otherwise wouldn't be really
   possible (friends in other countries, finding friends from elementary
   school, etc). However, I believe that the use of social media
   disincentivizes me from keeping real relationships with people and
   friends. I can see what people are up to on their social media page and
   sometimes that takes out the need to "catch up" with people. Which, in
   the end leads to no relationship at all aside from me checking on their
   media pages every now and again.

   Positive- Networking and knowledge.

   Negative - Distinct lack of ability to gain social skills and less
   empathetic behavior by most people.

   Neutral - Ability to find groups to belong to (this can lead to less
   debate or stronger debate depending on how the support of the group
   makes the individual act [ex. Others think like me I must be right]).

   I feel like social media is awesome because it allows you to maintain
   friendships even if that person is far away or you don't really talk to
   them anymore. Like, if I'm friends with you on fb or whatever but don't
   see you for months, I'll feel like I'm able to pick right up where we
   left off. Bad part is that I feel like it makes me incredibly insecure.
   Seeing other people's accomplishments and their trips around the world
   etc makes you feel like maybe you're doing something wrong. Especially
   when I applied to college. I felt like I had screwed up somehow bc I
   wasn't getting as many scholarships or acceptances. It got to the point
   where I had to unfollow and unfriend people so I could stop feeling so
   depressed about myself.

   It's good for keeping in the loop, but also let's people know they're
   not in the loop if they're not at something. Overall, I think it's a
   negative. Communication over the internet is great and has done amazing
   things, certainly shrinking the world. Social media however becomes a
   digitized popularity concert. In a sense it can be a good ego booster,
   but usually isn't. It's purpose is essentially to assert yourself over
   others. Let everyone know what you're doing so they know you're cool
   and out with friends, say something about Ferguson to make yourself
   seem like you're more morally active then they are. Messaging is for
   communicating, posting is for bragging. It ends up isolating people
   more than it connects them sometimes, and basically makes social life
   competitive. Passive aggression has never been so rampant.
   Communication is a big positive, social media is a big subliminal
   negative.

   For some positives, social media (most teenagers almost exclusively use
   twitter) let's you connect with EVERYONE. When you go to a school with
   1,000 students per class, it'd be impossible otherwise. I could send a
   message at 2 am to some girl i've never talked to in my life and make a
   new friend! Also, students who join clubs have an automatic reminder
   for meetings and events while on twitter. So in most cases, clubs
   create their own twitter accounts and post reminders of upcoming events
   and meetings, to keep their members engaged in the club, so that's a
   huge positive for me. An overall positive thing about it is that you
   have a general grasp of what's going on in your school or group of
   friends. It kinda functions as a daily newspaper for your school but in
   tweet form.

   Some negatives (other than the ones you've mentioned) are limited i
   think. A big one is that sometimes people seem more interested in
   checking their twitter or instagram feed instead of holding a normal
   conversation with eye contact and everything.

   Overall I'd say social media is great!

   a positive is always the fact that interaction online is definitely
   easier than speaking face-to-face. I've had multiple friends (and
   myself included) that have been talking to person from school online
   regularly, but are ignored during the day.

   A massive negative is easily sexting and sending nudes as teenagers.
   There have been countless nude leaks at my school, and since the victim
   is a minor, it is considered distributing child pornography and there
   have been multiple problems on twitter regarding that issue. In fact,
   you could search a girl at my school's name and the first search item
   on twitter is "___ ___ boobs".

   It's really easy to keep up with people without having to talk to them
   directly. But you also find out how shitty and annoying some people can
   be. Like you realize how desperate for attention and for some kind of
   validation most people are. Also nothing really important is ever going
   on on Twitter, so I'll try to stay away from it sometimes by doing
   something like watching a movie and leaving my phone in my room.

   I live in a fairly small midwestern town and social media has helped me
   find people with similar interests and know that there are people out
   there who are like me and I could be friends with when I move to a
   bigger city. It's also helped me learn about those interests in the
   first place and be exposed to all sorts of cool stuff I wouldn't have
   been otherwise (for example, Rookie Mag). Now I have "internet friends"
   which is kind of weird, but it's cool to talk to other ~teen girlz~ who
   share my sense of humor and are into the same things. One of them
   wanted to start a little online zine/blog and asked me to write for it,
   so that's an opportunity I wouldn't have had otherwise.

   Downsides: This sounds really bad, but I feel like knowing about all
   the cool people out there who know about all these cool things exist
   has made me more unsatisfied by people from school and maybe made me
   draw away from my irl friends a little bit (again, being in a small
   town, there aren't v many people who make me feel understood, whatever,
   in my head I guess I'm the protagonist of a 90s teen movie who has
   trouble fitting in at school). ALSO the obvious drawbacks like
   contributing to procrastination and being addicting.

   As a 28 year old reading these responses, I'm just glad that "social
   media" was barely a thing when I was a teenager. MySpace was all the
   rage, but it was just a thing, not taken seriously. When people started
   to migrate over to Facebook, it started to become more of a
   "networking" tool for those of us serious about who our friends were.
   But even then it wasn't taken as seriously as it is today.

   Cyber-bullying, catfishing, phishing... all of this wasn't even thought
   of back then, and no one cared if you posted something stupid. It was
   like the wild west. The worst thing we had to contend with were the

   As a somewhat shy person, it's useful to talk to people a bit more, or
   a way for your jokes/banter to be appreciated at a wider scale.

   I personally haven't been affected by this, but if you say something
   overly controversial or you get dragged onto a twitter fight, shit can
   get nasty. It becomes a year-wide thing of, for example, a couple who
   break up and have one night on twitter (for the whole school year to
   see) of passive aggressiveness, biterness, or whatever, with others in
   the year commenting and making snarky comments, or whatever. I imagine
   it's not exactly useful for your private life to be put on public.

   I don't use anything except Facebook, but I would say that for my
   social life, its contribution is mostly positive. It keeps me in touch
   with international friends, lets me see the highlights in friends'
   lives, and, in particular, offers a less formal means of communication
   between people I only know as acquaintances. At the same time it
   creates this bizarre indication of friendship, as though crossing that
   threshold and adding someone as a friend makes a relationship more
   official. Similarly, there are a catalogue of subtleties that are
   rarely explicitly discussed--the implications of liking someone's
   photo, of writing formally online, of posting a controversial article,
   etc.

   Overall, though, I notice myself developing vapid, narcissistic, and
   narrow-minded tendencies if I'm on Facebook too frequently. It's really
   natural to slip into scrolling through Top Stories, blindly staring at
   pretty girls and getting advertisements shoved down my throat. It's so
   easy for people to curate their profiles that there are inevitably
   glaring disparities between how people (and certainly myself) really
   are and the impressions they give through their online presence, but
   those virtual personas still give people real-life expectations.

   You subscribe to this pyramid scheme of voyeurism, buying into it with
   your own profile, and Facebook makes it so easy to judge people. It
   feels like it's okay to intrude on people's lives--and then form
   conclusions despite only having a superficial understanding--because
   they have actively allowed you into their circle of trust in accepting
   your request.

   I think a major negative of social media on my social life is that it
   can truly make things awkward between people. Sometimes you see someone
   on social media and you start creating your own ideas as to how that
   person must be, then you meet them and you are completely thrown off
   because they are completely different. This also happens with people I
   went to high school with when we get together you completely start
   judging someone you used to know based off of the image they are
   throwing off from their different social media profiles. When you then
   encounter these people its awkward because you think they have
   completely changed or you have just creeped on them so much you have to
   pretend not to know what is going on in their life when you actually
   do.

   I mean it obviously has lots of both advantages and disadvantages.
   Social media helps me keep in contact with friends I've made throughout
   my travels which is cool because they're awesome people and I probably
   wouldn't still talk to them otherwise.

   On the other hand however, social media makes me feel so much more left
   out sometimes. I'll stay home one Friday night and then check Instagram
   the next morning and see pictures of my friends who all went out
   without me the previous night. Not going to lie, it hurts. Years ago,
   before these sites existed, I would never have found out and therefore
   it wouldn't have bothered me but times have clearly changed.

   I honestly feel like we've become so obsessed with the amount of
   ''likes'' our pictures get. There's without a doubt a direct
   correlation between cleavage and likes on social media. And I'm not
   criticizing those who post pictures like that, you have the right to do
   so, but I feel like girls are more and more pressured to follow the
   growing trend.

   Social media, in my opinion, is creating a false world. People don't do
   anything just to do it anymore. You do it for the Insta, or for the
   vine etc. It's come to the point where I can't do anything with my
   friends without one of them suggesting we take a picture for Instagram.
   Don't get me wrong, I'm just as guilty. I'll go out for a nice meal
   with my family and upon receiving my plate I'll take a picture thinking
   ''Maybe I'll post this on Twitter later''. We're constantly trying to
   make people jealous, look where I am, who I'm with, what I'm eating,
   what I'm doing.We live less in the moment and more for others I find.

   I'm not a teenager, but when I was a teenager social media was still
   around [if not nearly as infected into society as it is now]. I did
   have a Facebook profile in high school... and a myspace one to boot.
   Hah.

   Technology is what you make it, and I don't think I've had too many
   negative experiences with social media. I don't post any pics online
   and have never really put my personal self onto any of these profiles
   so I don't think I can talk for everyone. Having a Facebook profile has
   allowed me to stay in touch with people after I moved out of town and
   I'm glad for the opportunity to be able to talk to them and catch up on
   their experiences. I don't use Twitter but I imagine if I did it would
   have a similar usage.

   I've been bullied a couple of times by people who I know in real life.
   It happened on a small PHPBB board ran by some kids from school; I was
   a power user - surprise - and they decided they didn't like me or my
   face and such. Oh well.

   My experiences with the internet and social media are very atypical of
   my age and gender group and the ones that came ahead of me, the ones
   you probably want to talk to right now. I have spent a good portion of
   the past seven years on the internet though, and I have a lot of
   opinions about it.

   Here's a great negative effect of social media on my life. Trying to
   spread and advertise my brand and getting bullied by online
   musclecrooks.

   You reek of desperation which is why you're being downvoted. You don't
   go in to someone else's Q&A to solely do self promotion. That's just
   poor form. Also your twitter isn't funny at all, so there's that, too.
