6 Concrete Steps To Building A Collaborative Culture That Inspires

   [50]Comment Now
   [51]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   This summer, I had the pleasure of visiting the headquarters of
   [52]ExecuNet, an online membership community 300,000+ members strong,
   dedicated to supporting and enriching executives around the globe.
   The minute I stepped through the door, I could “feel” the culture in a
   palpable way. It was inviting, upbeat, open, warm, and casual.  People
   just seemed happier and more relaxed than what I’ve observed in many
   corporate offices in which I’ve worked, coached and trained.

   Then something amazing happened.  The VP of Finance, Maggie Pisani
   (whom I’d never met and didn’t know by name), walked up to me as I was
   sitting in chair waiting for my meeting, and said, “Hi Kathy! I’ve
   heard a lot about you, and we’re all excited to have you today. I’m so
   sorry I can’t join you – I’m racing out to a baseball game. Please
   excuse my very casual attire! But I look forward to hearing all about
   your meeting and seeing you again soon.” Others welcomed me openly too,
   and our meeting revealed the same happy, collaborative vibe.

   Immediately, I knew this work culture was special, and after the
   meeting, my feeling was confirmed.  I asked Tony Vlahos, Chief
   Marketing Officer and Mark Anderson, President of ExecuNet, to share
   with me more about the culture, and some lessons other leaders and
   small businesses can learn to help them build open, collaborative (and
   happy) workplaces.

   At meeting
   Here’s what they shared:

   Kathy Caprino: Tony, what goes into making a collaborative culture that
   encourages loyalty, trust and cooperation, exactly?

   Tony Vlahos: We believe that a collaborative culture is based on
   openness, complete transparency and building trust.  It also focuses
   its energy on the search for solutions to challenges and leveraging
   opportunities rather than on placing blame or searching for “guilty.”

   Here, we are vigilantly committed to being open and transparent with
   our team and employees. At monthly staff meetings, we keep the entire
   team aware of how we are doing—the “good, bad and the “ugly” — in terms
   of our customer feedback and performance.  We also regularly have
   middle managers present and showcase themselves and their teams to
   encourage real ownership and a focus on results at all levels.

   You’ve heard of Tonys and Emmys. Well, our award here is a brand
   statement we call “MELBAs” – Making Executives Lives Better.  We’ve
   created these awards and utilize them regularly to recognize the
   contributions of employees who’ve made a difference. Employees proudly
   hang these recognition awards in their cubicles and offices.

   Since our corporate assets walk out the door each night, over the
   years, we’ve also made it clear that people are what’s important — and
   not just what they do in business.  Advocacy, flexibility, empathy and
   support for our employees who go through tough times and in their
   personal lives is something that sets apart a collaborative, caring
   organization.  A respect for family commitments outside the office
   enables team members to avoid missing that special event.  When people
   leave, we traditionally continue to view them as an extended ExecuNet
   “family”— such that some have been rehired at a later date—and continue
   to maintain strong ties.

   Kathy: Do you think a collaborative, thriving culture can be built and
   sustained if the top leaders don’t have the right mindset?

   Tony: No.  It’s not possible.  Staff looks to leadership to set the
   tone — always has and always will.  If the passion, commitment and
   follow-through are missing, the workforce knows it.  If the top leaders
   don’t consistently show respect for the people they work with and treat
   people fairly and well, they won’t elicit the commitment and
   collaboration they expect or want.

   We also believe in keeping the sense of hierarchy as low as possible so
   that everyone feels they can be equal contributors.  All offices are
   roughly the same size with the same size large internal windows.  This
   limits the feeling of “closed door meetings” and levels the playing
   field, reducing the experience of silos.

   Here, the Chairman, David Opton, and the President have always
   exemplified the type of servant leadership that helps galvanize the
   team.  The small things make a big difference. From being the last to
   get new furniture, to participating in parking in the most distant
   parking places when it was their turn — they put into practice what is
   expected of leadership and the entire workforce.

   Keeping things light with humor is also an important part of the
   culture and mindset.  Having fun while you work is an ingredient we
   like to reinforce and keep in balance.  It sets a positive, fun tone
   for the organization.

   Kathy: What are a few small steps that ExecuNet takes, and others can
   adopt easily, to keep their cultures thriving?
   Tony: We do a number of unusual things that are highly effective:

   Communicate openly every day to the entire staff

   Everyday team members get a short internal email, essentially a blog
   post, called the ExecuNet Buzz.  It highlights the “goings on for the
   day”–  visitors, major meetings, ins and outs of staff, birthdays,
   anniversaries, etc.

   Its purpose is to keep things transparent and reduce the “water cooler”
   talk about what is going on or who’s visiting and walking around.  It
   includes a Trivia Question for the day and inspiring and humorous
   quotes to inform, enlighten and engage the team.   Those who answer the
   Trivia Question incorrectly get humorously highlighted in the next
   day’s Buzz but employees start their day with a fun read.

   Involve the entire team in interviewing and onboarding of new hires

   We conduct thorough interviewing and on-boarding of new hires as a team
   approach, so candidates get a very good feel for collaboration and
   teamwork from the outset – and also get a taste of the intimacy of
   meeting and working with those they’ll be collaborating with in the
   future.

   We’ve also implemented an extensive on-boarding approach for new hires
   so they meet personally with each department for lunch in the first
   several weeks without a business purpose.  It breaks down barriers
   around who the “newbie” is (regardless of rank) from the outset.

   Reinforce your history

   We maintain traditions and keep alive our ExecuNet history through
   pictures and funny stories to capture and support our culture.  Many
   stories surround our events.  Since we encourage team members to dress
   in costume for Halloween to show their creativity and their “other
   selves,” we have lots to share.  Prizes are voted on by the entire
   company.

   Celebrate personal life

   For example, we celebrate birthdays in reverse.  Instead of team
   members celebrating another teammate’s birthday as a small group, the
   person with the birthday brings in things to celebrate their own
   birthday and they share this with the entire company—so no one feels
   left out.  As we have grown larger, we’ve learned that you move quickly
   when “treats” are put out.

   Honor the individual

   We celebrate the individual at our monthly staff meeting in an activity
   called the “For the Good of the Order.”  At the end of our monthly
   staff meetings, a quick go around of sharing is enabled so anyone can
   share something that is personally important to them – typically
   something not work related but sometimes a recognition of help from
   another person.  It is not mandatory but comes with the express
   requirement that no one reacts to the sharing—just listens.  It is
   meant as real leveler for people and gives them all a chance to share
   something important to them.

   Encourage personal connection

   We make our employees feel a part of the organization by encouraging
   them to get to know everyone on the team.  We’ve established an
   independent employee group, known as “The Committee,” to plan team
   events, picnics, lunches, etc.  We give them a small budget and every
   6-8 weeks they plan interactions and experiences that help people get
   to know others.  These events have ranged from an “international
   luncheon” where our diverse group of employees brings in a special dish
   to celebrate the opening of baseball season, to a jeopardy game about
   company history.  Our “Why Wine” events at the end of the day are an
   excuse to celebrate a recent success or important event.

   In the end, we know that our culture and the way we interact and engage
   is the single most important thing we can build and create, and we
   focus on it every day.
