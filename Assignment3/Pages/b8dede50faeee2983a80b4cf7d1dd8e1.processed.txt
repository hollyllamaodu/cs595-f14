     * [49]Taking the conversation to the next level at the Women &
       Working Families Summit
    Organizers in Illinois got together with some special guests to talk
       about what's next in the fight for women's economic equality.

       On August 14th, more than 75 community organizers and advocates
       attended the Women & Working Families Summit, hosted by OFA and the
       [52]Center for American Progress Action Fund at the Community
       Organizing Institute at OFA headquarters in Chicago.
       Kate Black from American Women kicked off the summit with a
       discussion of the messaging and strategy behind the efforts to
       secure economic opportunities for women, like equal pay and raising
       the minimum wage.

       Brunson Jones from the [53]Chicago Foundation for Women moderated a
       riveting panel featuring four experts with four different
       perspectives. Wendy Pollack (Sargent Shriver National Center on
       Policy Law) updated folks on progress we're seeing in Illinois;
       Ellen-Blair Chube of Ariel Investments spoke as an executive of a
       company that values workplace policies that support women and
       working families; Allison Zelman (Center for American Progress),
       brought a national policy perspective to the conversation; and
       Traci Coney, a home health care worker, told her personal story
       about struggling to make ends meet while caring for her sister.
       [a27b3e1f10404066903d93da34f1812d_wmnsummit_crop_final.jpg] The
       evening was capped by our special guest speaker, Tina Tchen, the
       executive director of the White House Council on Women & Girls, and
       chief of staff to First Lady Michelle Obama. She talked about how
       thrilled she was to be home to Chicago to discuss some of the key
       takeaways from the White House Summit on Working Families and the
       Fair Shot Summit, which were held earlier this year in Washington.
       "These are broad-based economic issues," Tina said. "These are not
       just individual issues." That's why we will continue to fight to
       support working families.
       [7580c6bf66984df58ad0f179ae6c9127_wmnsummit_tchen_final.jpg] It was
       an honor for OFA to host so many members of the progressive
       community and supporters who care deeply about how we can to make
       progress for women and working families.
       This is just one step in the fight. [54]Add your support—join the
