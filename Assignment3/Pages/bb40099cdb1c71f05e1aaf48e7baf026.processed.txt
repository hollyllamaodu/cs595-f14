Terminate The Terminator: Hack Your Emotional Intelligence And Control Your
Future

   [46]Comment Now
   [47]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Want to leave your number one business rival lying in a crumpled pile
   of rubble? Then put down your Android for a minute so you can size up
   exactly who that opponent is.

   The assassin most likely to destroy your business isn’t the guy down
   the street. It’s not a brilliant 19-year-old coder lying in wait in a
   ranch house in Palo Alto.

   It’s a ‘bot that does what you do—even better.

   The singularity may sound like science fiction, but robots already
   write articles for newspapers’ sports sections, do surgery, fly jets
   and drones in the military, drive cars and answer phone calls for
   hotels and service firms. Bots beat our best chess champions on
   strategy. And they’re better managers than some leaders. [48]Recent
   work from a doctoral student at MIT found that people would rather work
   for a robot boss who gave out tasks than a person.

   If robots can be encoded with artificial, emotional intelligence and it
   is greater than what you and your team have to offer to guests, you
   will be out of work. And emotional intelligence in robots is closer
   than you’d think.

   Want to keep a brainy, rolling hunk of metal from flattening you? Prep
   yourself to steal gigs from the “terminators” of the future by doing
   these five things:

   Get Emotionally-Sharp. Smart leaders defend their businesses from the
   borgs by developing specialized knowledge, charged with super-talented
   human skills and emotional intelligence.  They know that customers want
   to go where they feel like they’re being seen and heard. If you don’t
   “get” customers better than a ‘bot, they’ll choose the ‘bot.

   Train yourself and your people with the latest research on the uses of
   emotional intelligence. And look for talent that is strong in this
   area. When I interview people, I ask: If you were to build a robot
   right now to replicate you, what 10 things would it need to have? I get
   all different types of answers. What I look for are qualities like
   integrity, tenacity, creativity, emotional maturity, leadership talent,
   conscientiousness, and perseverance.

   Kick Off The SWAT Suit.  You can’t get a good read on customers’
   feelings if your own are buried under 20 layers of scar tissue. Let
   your emotions rise before the machines do.

   Sharpen your self-awareness by grilling yourself in challenging
   situations: How am I feeling about this? What internal and external
   resources can I bring to the table to help me solve this problem? How
   can I tap into what I’m most passionate about to achieve my goal? How
   am I feeling relative to what I want to accomplish?

   Listen to your body, but don’t accept physiological reactions at face
   value. Feeling tense? Ask yourself: What is this tension communicating
   to me? What’s unresolved here? What am I concerned about? What have I
   left hanging?

   Stay In The Cool.  It’s on you if you let customers or staff launch
   your nuclear buttons and you end up acting like Kanye, Chris, or
   Charlie. It means you need to work on self-regulation. It’s an
   important muscle of emotional intelligence.

   To diagnose where you’re going wrong and fix it, ask yourself some key
   questions: What in your behavior is preventing you from doing what’s
   necessary to accomplish your goals? What behavior do you need to stop?
   What do you need to do more of? What is keeping you from doing these
   things now? Then commit to doing what it takes, power on, and go
   through the pain to fix the problem.

   Speak Truth To Power.  Ditch the sales pitch and be honest and genuine
   with your customers. Let them know what’s up. Be direct, open,
   honorable. At my companies, we pay close attention to how customers are
   feeling, and you should do that, too. Acknowledge that you’ve heard
   them. Make time for them. Prioritize them. Let them know how you feel
   about them. Tell them what you value about them. Don’t take anything
   for granted. Ever.

   Stay Pumped. To keep yourself inspired, align your passion and values
   with your objectives —keep them in lock step. Form positive images and
   feelings inside you with the behaviors and actions that let you succeed
   in your work—and pin negative images and feelings to the actions that
   derail you. For example, if you’d rather surf the net than talk with
   customers, reward yourself when you get over it and take one of them to
   lunch. Or find a partner who loves people. We must gain leverage on
   ourselves and step out of the Tempur-Pedic zone. Otherwise, watch your
   back. Optimus Prime is ready to put you out of business.

       This so much relates to what I call “IPC Marketing”. With the
       “Robot” scare there are those who adamantly feel we are going to be
       taken over by robots and I vehemently disagree because of “IPC
       Marketing”.
       Thanks for the post!

       Very informative and right on the mark. It’s gotten so bad, that I
       stopped writing deep content in order to get indexed by Google
       because their algorithm keeps changing. Your right, its all about
       to be automated by computers.

       Thank you, Joshua! Creative, heart-felt content will still matter
       to Google. Because it matters to the people they are trying to
       please.

       thanks for your insight Eric. It always seems ironic to me what an
       important part of business honesty is; we don’t hear about it often
       enough! There were obvious efficiencies in creating robots to do
       the jobs workers traditionally performed, to a very high standard
       it should be said. Now we are seeing robots not just on the factory
       floor but in middle management and even at board level, and that is
       forcing people to question their levels of emotional intelligence,
       where previously decisions went unchallenged. This can be a good
       thing, it will challenge the status quo, certainly, and keep us all
       on our toes. But is staying cool the answer. Sometimes the
       over-emotional go to places that others, including Optimus Prime,
       cannot reach! Losing our cool and acting irrationally is the only
       weapon in our arsenal currently that cannot be replicated.
       Unpredictability is still king?

       Thanks, Edmund! Ultimately, you are right, it can be a good thing.
       It takes everyone’s game up. Passion will also always be important,
       because it unleashes creativity that bots will have a harder time
       replicating from us.

       Great post Eric. In this age of social media, it’s funny that we
       have to remind people to be social/human. Go figure.
