   The subject of race can be very touchy. As finance executive Mellody
   Hobson says, it's a "conversational third rail." But, she says, that's
   exactly why we need to start talking about it. In this engaging,
   persuasive talk, Hobson makes the case that speaking openly about race
   — and particularly about diversity in hiring — makes for better
   businesses and a better society.
