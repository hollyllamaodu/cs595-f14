   Rishi Manchanda has worked as a doctor in South Central Los Angeles for
   a decade, where he’s come to realize: His job isn’t just about treating
   a patient’s symptoms, but about getting to the root cause of what is
   making them ill—the “upstream" factors like a poor diet, a stressful
   job, a lack of fresh air. It’s a powerful call for doctors to pay
   attention to a patient's life outside the exam room.

   [52]Rishi Manchanda
   Physician
   Rishi Manchanda is an "upstreamist." A physician and public health
   innovator, he aims to reinvigorate primary care by teaching doctors to
   think about—and treat—the social and environmental conditions that
   often underly sickness. [53]Full bio
