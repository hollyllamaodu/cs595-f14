   I live in Los Angeles and I'm lucky enough to write about the thing I
   love most: movies. I'm a graduate of Vassar College and Northwestern
   University and I've been working at Forbes since 2001. For a good chunk
   of the year I obsess over celebrity paydays for the Celebrity 100 list.
   The rest of the year I'm working the beat. If I'm not behind my
   computer or out on an interview you can find me at the beach with my
   two kids ... or at the movies. Follow me on Twitter

Five Websites Hollywood Can Still Buy Now That Maker And Fullscreen Are Off
The Table

   [48]Comment Now
   [49]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments
   Fullscreen's 2014 InTour featured Jc Caylen and Dylan Dauzat

   Chances are you’ve never heard of Fullscreen and if you know Maker,
   it’s only because [50]Disney recently bought the company for $500
   million (that price could go up to $950 million if the company meets
   certain targets). Both companies are what are known as multi channel
   networks, online groups of YouTube sites that bring a bunch of creators
   under one roof. Maker has big stars like [51]PewDiePie and [52]Epic Rap
   Battles.  Fullscreen has The [53]Fine Brothers and [54]Shane Dawson.

   Earlier this week [55]AT&T [56]AT&T and Peter Chernin joined forces to
   buy Fullscreen in a deal worth a reported $200 to $300 million. Big
   media companies are buying up these companies to get an immediate,
   powerful toehold in the digital world. Fullscreen’s network of
   YouTubers boasts 475 million subscribers and almost 4 billion views in
   the past month. Chernin, the producer behind films like Planet of the
   Apes and TV shows like New Girl, can tap the talent on Fullscreen for
   new shows and he can use the online outlet to help promote his content.

   AT&T can use Fullscreen to help promote its U-Verse high speed Internet
   service and maybe even offer Fullscreen content as a standalone
   subscription service.

   “Fullscreen could play into a bundled offering from AT&T,” says Peter
   Csathy CEO of Manatt Digital Media. “They could sell access to premium
   channels on Fullscreen.”

   We have yet to see how big media companies actually use these MCNs.
   It’s tricky because these companies are built on the strength of fans
   who have (or feel they have) direct relationships with the YouTube
   stars they follow.

   Those fans don’t want a corporation like Disney or AT&T getting in the
   way, charging for content or turning their beloved stars into corporate
   shills.

   But there’s no denying short-form online videos are a big part of the
   new mix of media which is why you see these companies spending so much
   on these MCNs.

   Maker and Fullscreen were the two biggest independent MCNs after
   [57]Awesomeness TV was bought by [58]DreamWorks Animation
   [59]DreamWorks Animation last year for $33 million (which could grow to
   $117 million depending on Awesomeness hitting certain milestones). All
   of these companies have a broad array of different kinds of channels.

   The MCNs that are left standing are smaller niche sites. Csathy says we
   can expect Hollywood to turn its attention to this space next when
   media companies go looking for Internet content. Some sites he believes
   Hollywood is now eyeing:

   [60]StyleHaul

   The fashion and beauty MCN boasts 175 million network subscribers and
   4,500 channels like [61]Cute Polish which features tutorials on
   different kinds of manicures. Bertelsmann’s Digital Media Arm [62]has
   already contributed to two funding rounds totaling $17 million so the
   German company has the inside track if it wants to buy StyleHaul. But
   Csathy says he could see a make up or beauty brand buying the site.
   Look at [63]Red Bull [64]Red Bull. It used be known just as a drink but
   now it represents a certain kind of lifestyle content online.
   StyleHaul, which includes original shows like Lisa Kudrow’s Web
   Therapy, could do the same for the right beauty brand.

   [65]Machinima

   What StyleHaul is to beauty and fashion, Machinima is to video gaming.
   Its 175 million monthly hits come mostly from the coveted 18-to-34 male
   demographic. The company includes video-game playing stars like
   [66]SkyDoesMinecraft and  [67]Jerome ASF. In March Warner Bros.[68] led
   an $18 million investing round in the company after it lost its CEO and
   laid off 42 people. Chad Gutstein moved from the Ovation network to run
   Machinima. Expect [69]Time Warner [70]Time Warner to be at the front of
   the line if the company is sold.

   [71]Whistle Sports

   Think of it as [72]ESPN [73]ESPN for the next generation. The sports
   content comes from fans and athletes and features tutorials on golf
   swings alongside GoPro videos of a game called Spikball. With 7.6
   million subscribers and 170 channels, its smaller than some other sites
   but sports sells. If would be a natural fit for an ESPN, a sports
   league or a company like Gatorade that wants its brand associated with
   cool, young athletes.

   [74]Tastemade
   The MCN for foodies, Tastemade is more focused on branded entertainment
   than selling ads. The two-year old company, which has 15 million
   subscribers, has a fall lineup of brand-sponsored shows in partnership
   with companies like General Mills and Hyundai. [75]According to The
   Wall Street Journal,  General Mills is using Tastemade’s talent to
   promote the 30th anniversary of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Hyundai’s show
   will feature tailgating. Not surprisingly, Scripps Networks (the
   company behind The Food Network) [76]recently led a $25 million
   investment round in Tastemade.

   [77] MiTu

   With divisions for lifestyles, music and “macho” MiTu is an MCN aimed
   at Latinos. MiTu boasts 39 million subscribers and 158,000 videos.
   Chernin, who just bought Fullscreen, owns a piece of MiTu as does
   Upfront Ventures which was an early investor in Maker. Any company
   looking to expand into the lucrative Latino market could make a run for
   MiTu or it could go to an established Hispanic player like Univision or
   Telemundo.
