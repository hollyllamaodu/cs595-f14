       [45]Alison Gopnik [46]What do babies think?
       "Babies and young children are like the R&D division of the human
       species," says psychologist Alison Gopnik. Her research explores
       the sophisticated intelligence-gathering and decision-making that
       babies are really doing when they play.

       where children can explore and learn from each other — using
       resources and mentoring from the cloud. Hear his inspiring vision

       [65]Kakenya Ntaiya [66]A girl who demanded school
       Kakenya Ntaiya made a deal with her father: She would undergo the
       traditional Maasai rite of passage of female circumcision if he
       would let her go to high school. Ntaiya tells the fearless story of
       continuing on to college, and of working with her village elders to
       build a school for girls in her community. It’s the educational
       journey of one that altered the destiny of 125 young women. (Filmed
       at TEDxMidAtlantic.)

       space, she calls on educators to teach both the arts and sciences,
       both intuition and logic, as one — to create bold thinkers.

       Educating the poor is more than just a numbers game, says Shukla
       Bose. She tells the story of her groundbreaking Parikrma Humanity
       Foundation, which brings hope to India's slums by looking past the
       daunting statistics and focusing on treating each child as an
       individual.

       [80]Shane Koyczan [81]To This Day ... for the bullied and beautiful
       By turn hilarious and haunting, poet Shane Koyczan puts his finger
       on the pulse of what it's like to be young and … different. "To
       This Day," his spoken-word poem about bullying, captivated millions
       as a viral video (created, crowd-source style, by 80 animators).
       Here, he gives a glorious, live reprise with backstory and violin
       accompaniment by Hannah Epperson.

       [85]Charles Leadbeater [86]Education innovation in the slums
       Charles Leadbeater went looking for radical new forms of education
       — and found them in the slums of Rio and Kibera, where some of the
       world's poorest kids are finding transformative new ways to learn.
       And this informal, disruptive new kind of school, he says, is what
       all schools need to become.

       Salman Khan talks about how and why he created the remarkable Khan
       Academy, a carefully structured series of educational videos
       offering complete curricula in math and, now, other subjects. He
       shows the power of interactive exercises, and calls for teachers to
       consider flipping the traditional classroom script — give students
       video lectures to watch at home, and do "homework" in the classroom
       with the teacher available to help.
