Is Ebola Coming To America? Experts Ponder As Ebola Epidemic Worsens In
Africa.

   [48]Comment Now
   [49]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Sept. 30 update: CDC [50]has confirmed the first case of Ebola
   diagnosed in the United States.

   New CDC and WHO data suggest that Africa’s Ebola outbreak is worse than
   expected — and in a worst-case scenario, the current Ebola epidemic
   could become endemic.

   And those gloomy projections have experts worried that Ebola will
   inevitably arrive in the United States.

   [51]Sept. 30 Update: First Case Of Ebola Diagnosed in United States

   According to CDC [52]modeling released on Tuesday, Liberia and Sierra
   Leone are on track to have 21,000 cases of Ebola by September 30,
   unless the situation rapidly improves. (The CDC’s estimate is based on
   an assumption that [53]more than half of all Ebola cases will not be
   reported or detected.)

   CDC also estimates that as many as 1.4 million people in Liberia and
   Sierra Leone could contract Ebola by January 20.
     * Given that about 10 million people live in Liberia and Sierra
       Leone, that estimate suggests that about one in seven residents
       would contract Ebola.
     * The current outbreak has a mortality rate of more than 70%.

   (For a sense of perspective on CDC’s worst-case scenario for West
   Africa: If a similarly sized outbreak happened in the United States,
   more than 45 million Americans would contract Ebola.)

   [54]Also See: Nearly 40% Of Americans Fear An Ebola Outbreak

   In separate projections released on Monday, the World Health
   Organization offered up a dire warning: There might not be an easy
   solution for the current Ebola epidemic, given the outbreak’s rate and
   pace.

   Instead, Ebola could become a lasting problem for Africa.

   “We must therefore face the possibility that [Ebola] will become
   endemic among the human population of West Africa, a prospect that has
   never previously been contemplated,” the WHO Ebola Response Team wrote
   in the [55]New England Journal of Medicine.

   “The risk of continued epidemic expansion and the prospect of endemic
   EVD in West Africa call for the most forceful implementation of present
   control measures and for the rapid development and deployment of new
   drugs and vaccines.”

   However, in a best-case scenario, CDC says that the new mobilization of
   public health efforts and U.S. military support will be able to contain
   Ebola and end the current epidemic by January 20.

   “My gut feeling is, the actions we’re taking now are going to make that
   worst-case scenario not come to pass,” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who runs
   the CDC, told the [56]New York Times. “But it’s important to understand
   that it could happen.”

   Bad News In Africa Only Bodes Poorly For World
   The continued persistence of the Ebola epidemic has experts
   increasingly pessimistic about a quick solution.

   Ebola cases in West Africa are rising faster than hospital beds are
   available. And the outbreak’s spread is seemingly accelerating. (Chart
   via virologist [57]Ian Mackay.)

   Ebola

   The longer the Ebola outbreak rages, the more likely it is that the
   disease will mutate into an even more dangerous form. Scott Gottlieb,
   who served as a top FDA official under President George W. Bush,
   believes that at least several cases of Ebola will come to America, and
   has [58]warned that there’s even a chance that the disease could go
   airborne.

   But there are signs of hope, even in West Africa. As David Kroll — who
   has so ably tracked the Ebola outbreak for Forbes — [59]reported
   yesterday, nearby Nigeria has been able to remain free from Ebola. At
   Vox, Brad Plumer has [60]reviewed the evidence of Ebola going airborne,
   and finds that the odds are “very unlikely.”

   Government officials also continue to stress that there’s little chance
   of a mass Ebola outbreak in the United States, a point that the NIH’s
   Anthony Fauci [61]reiterated to Congress last week. And even if a few
   Ebola patients arrive in the U.S., the nation’s hospitals would be
   well-equipped to handle them.

   [62]Also See: All 68 Suspected Cases Of Ebola In United States Have
   Been False Alarms

   “Controlling Ebola is not a very sophisticated task,” Dr. Amesh Adalja,
   a biosecurity specialist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
   Center, told [63]The Hill last week. “Ebola outbreaks are stopped in
   their tracks when basic public health measures are in place … and the
   United States would not be a hospitable environment for something that
   spreads exclusively through blood and body fluids.”

   Writing in the Advisory Board Daily Briefing, we’ve tracked the Ebola
   epidemic’s spread pretty closely, from covering the [64]early outbreak
   in Guinea to creating a [65]timeline of how the deadliest Ebola
   epidemic in history has spread.

   Earlier this month, researchers [66]estimated that there was up to an
   18% chance that at least one case of Ebola would arrive in the United
   States by September 22. (Not counting the four health workers
   intentionally brought to the U.S. for treatment.)
   As of press time on September 23, the number of Ebola cases in the
   United States remained at zero.

       There will inevitably be cases of Ebola in the United States. It
       will not spread as quickly due to superior sanitation and public
       hygeine and it will not be as uniformly lethal as in Africa. The
       whole situation seems very similar to the cholera situation in the
       nineteenth century and will probably follow a similar arc in a
       greatly compressed time frame compared to cholera.

       Ebola will eventually consume every developing nation in the world
       as they all share distrust of their government, and lack the
       medical infrastructure, personnel and supplies to contain clusters
       as they appear. A reservoir of the virus will develop and it will
       become endemic. Travelers will soon introduce it regularly to the
       US. Clusters will become increasingly more common and flare up
       daily basis in advanced countries and eventually outpace our
       ability to contain/separate/quarantine ALL those exposed. Ebola is
       here to stay, coming to the US and will forever change the face of
       medicine.
       Though our local hospital systems are giving lip service saying
       they are ready for an Ebola outbreak, they also readily admit that
       there is not ONE spare negative pressure room available in
       Springfield, Missouri, ever. (There is a 100% occupancy rate
       without Ebola.)
       Civilization is in big trouble.

       Well at least you understand the potential for global disaster

       there were only a few hundred cases, and there was hope of
       containment.

       It seems like every year there is a global pandemic threat of some
       sort. SARS, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, Spanish Flu, now Ebola. Modern
       medicine has come so far over the last 100 years, but how this
       disease, which has wiped out a large portion of the world centuries
       ago, can not have an effective treatment is beyond me.
       The world is about to get more dangerous. Unfortunately I have to
       travel for work a lot to Europe, and living with 2 daughters and a
       husband, this scares me given Russia, Ukraine, and the state of the
       Middle East. My advice? Life is short, enjoy it. Live each day as
       if it were your last and do your best to make an impact on this
       world. Keep healthy mentally, physically, and spiritually. Be
       prepared financially in case your time comes sooner than later. You
       don’t want to leave your family a financial burden. Life insurance
       is only $12 a month (Life Ant and Silver Rock are both super
       cheap). I know because I purchased it recently. Hearing about stuff
       like this makes me very happy that I did too.

       Dan I haven’t seen you talk about the problem with flu season being

       wild” in the US (as opposed to a victim being flown here under
       isolation for treatment), you and I both know its going to be _all_
       over the news media 24/7 and that the way they search for ebola
       cases to quarantine in Africa is “flu-like symptoms”. Think.

       Of course there’s an easy solution.
       When we perceive potential threats, we sometimes send our military
       to stop them preemptively.
       Send troops in NBC gear over there now. Enforce a quarantine, no
       one leaves their home for 2 weeks. Food is brought in by aid
       workers in bio gear. Anyone who breaks quarantine is shot and
       burned on the spot.
       Problem solved.

       Skeeter,
       Having spent time in Zimbabwe and South Africa, two of the more
       advanced nations in Africa, I can tell you that the entire US Army
       would not be enough to do what you suggest. You are assuming
       Africans work like people in Europe or the US. They don’t. The
       majority are exceedingly superstitious, have intense distrust of
       the Government and especially foreigners, and are woefully ignorant
       of how diseases spread. They will wantonly attack any quarantine,
       even if they have nothing but shovels and sticks, and their numbers
       will overwhelm whatever you throw at them, because body counts
       don’t matter to them.
       This will continue to spread throughout Africa, and nothing will
       stop it. What happens when it gets out of the continent? Who can
       say. I do, however, think this article is interesting, as it is
       from the same author who not too long ago was mocking anyone who
       considered an outbreak in the US possible.

       “…the United States would not be a hospitable environment for
       something that spreads exclusively through blood and body fluids.”
       This view of ebola’s limitations has been debunked. It can travel
       through the air via droplets emitted from coughing or sneezing.
       Unlike measles, when the droplets dry out (evaporate), the virus
       dies. That means that ebola doesn’t have complete
       air-transmissibility. But you *can* contract the disease without
       touching an infected patient. That’s proven.
       http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-20341423
       High humidity very likely works to extend the time it takes for
       droplets to evaporate, and therefore the range within which it’s
       possible to become infected.

       It seems that when it comes to the fear of a potential outbreak of
       Ebola in the U.S., the conversation overwhelmingly centers around a
       possible mutation that would allow the virus to go airborne, thus
       making any potential outbreak extremely difficult to control.
       Without such a mutation, more often than not, authors point out the
       superiority of the U.S. health care system and resources which
       would “no doubt” limit any potential outbreak. The controlled
       response in Nigeria and Senegal are referred to often as well, as
       an illustration of what would likely happen if the virus was to
       spread to more developed international countries. There are a
       number of factors that people must begin to consider:
       1) In Senegal there was only one suspected case, yet 74 separate
       contacts had to be found, (immediately no less), and tracked for
       more than 3 weeks to ensure the spread was eliminated. In Nigeria,
       there were 21 cases, all of whom had to be interviewed at length,
       after which, per the WHO’s Situation Report, 874 contacts had to be
       located and monitored for more than three weeks, many of whom are
       still being monitored. The human resources required to pull this
       off were enormous. The reported and unreported cases are now well
       over 6,000 in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, so you can
       imagination how difficult it has now become to get ahead of the
       spread, especially considering so many of the infected have not
       been interviewed and potential contacts are not being monitored,
       (not to mention that in urban centers, it is extremely difficult to
       truly discover all potential contacts). As such, it is not remotely
       unrealistic to expect, even with the additional resources being
       sent into these countries, that the outbreak will reach into the
       hundreds of thousands by early in the new year.
       2) Given the exponential growth of Ebola, (doubling every 3 weeks),
       it has been reported, and is statistically clear anyway, that the R
       factor is 2, meaning every infected person infects another 2
       people. With this type of infectiousness, it is difficult to
       comprehend why people continue to believe that Ebola is only being
       spread through direct contact with infected, most notably the
       mishandling of the dead. A study conducted by the Canadian Food
       Inspection Agency and the Canadian Department of Health, published
       in Scientific Reports in 2012, put forth a very compelling argument
       that Ebola was transmitted through bodily fluids that could be
       propelled through the air and live for short periods of time, such
       as those fluids excreted through the act of sneezing or coughing.
       They had infected pigs in a cage within very close proximity to a
       cage of healthy non-human primates (NHP). The NHP could not
       directly touch the infected pigs, yet within a short period of
       time, many of the NHP had become infected. While I would never
       argue that Ebola is anything like the flu in this regard, it is not
       NEARLY as difficult to become infected as many authors and experts
       make on.
       3) Based on the number of cases to come, the relative ease with
       which a person can become infected and the resources required to
       slow or stop a spread using traditional monitoring methods, I
       cannot fathom how people convince themselves that the West Africa
       outbreak will not spread internationally. With each new case, it
       becomes more and more difficult to confine the spread to the three
       countries currently most impacted. It will eventually make its way
       out, as it has already, but it will do so in a much more aggressive
       way, making it very difficult to control. When the first cases were
       discovered in Nigeria, the total number of infected was only 1,000,
       making it much easier to allocate resources. Try allocating
       appropriate resources when the number of cases is in the hundreds
       of thousands, or millions.
       If/when this comes to the U.S., I fully expect multiple clusters
       and eventually a breakout difficult to control. But here’s hoping
       I’m wrong.

       So according to the CDC there could be 1.4 million cases or zero
       cases by Jan 20th. Here’s a suggestion: find all the live and
       deadly viruses in your own buildings before you tell us that
       anything about Ebola, which by the way is probably already airborne
       despite your protestations and headed for the US in short order.

       Do you believe the CDC will keep you safe. Here’s just one scenario
       where they already endangered us. Dr. Brantly came down with Ebola
       at the end of July and in a scant 4 weeks he was declared ‘no
       threat to public health’ and released by an Atlanta hospital. Well
       according to the CDC’s own website Ebola can survive in semen up to
       3 months (3 times as long as he was quarantined). Well what if our
       good Dr. decided to party it up with a girlfriend, his wife ..and
       then a couple more girlfriends. By the way the hospital that
       treated him still can’t even make any contractor properly dispose
       of human and medical the waste…from just one person. We aren’t
       prepared and if you aren’t afraid you should be.

       IIRC, the Ebola virus remains infectious in the semen of any man
       cured of the disease for seven weeks. Unless we are going to
       quarantine those lucky men who managed to survive the disease for
       another seven weeks, then their next set of sexual partners will
       get a gift that keeps on giving…

       Funny when it’s an American infected we can always help. SMDH! Why
       aren’t the Africans receiving the #ebola disease treatment the
       Americans received and lived? Wake up people! What is the back
       story? Do the journalist work of fact checking to find the true
       story ~ Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How.
       Africa isn’t Poor! Africa aids the World! Foreigners ~ Colonialism
       governments, companies and individuals have been stealing African
       Rich Resources for centuries (Labor, Land, Gold, Oil, Diamonds,
       Cooper, Natural Gas, Copper Iron and etc). The estimate is $192
       billions annually is taken out of Africa with no reinvestment in
       people and infrastructure. How do Foreigners accomplish Genocide in
       21st Century to Steal Resources? Setup puppet leader, Manufacture
       Internal Wars, Provide Guns, Manufacture Disease for biological
       wars, and setup hierarchies based on skin color which are
       reinforced by the people.
       Africa is rising again and taking charge scares the corporate world
       and government leaders G7 and BRIC Nations. The new emerging market
       of black millionaires/billionaires. The corporate media can no
       longer feed their BS agendas. Love it!
       The American model of genocide which murdered, intentionally spread
       diseases, and looted the Resources of 500 Nations of Native
       Americans is being used killing 100 million+. The only difference,
       Africa’s land areas and you can’t steal resources and get rid of
       1.5 billion+ people easily.
       The G8 Summits now the G-7 minus Russia world leaders meet outside
       of the United Nations 2-4 times a year. Who represents Africa and
       the Middle East at these meetings? Today, Africa and the Middle
       East are the Prime Targets for Foreigners colonialism to steal
       resources and say “It’s not Personal, It’s Just Business”. The
       usual suspects for stealing Africa’s resources
       (1). #G7 Summit New Global Domination Participants: United States,
       United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Canada, and European
       Union.
       (2). #BRIC Nations: Brazil, Russia, India, China
       The World is constantly being brainwashed with images poverty and
       internal “tribal” wars, starving people, corruption, now “Al Qaeda”
       training sites. The only time we are shown Africa’s beauty is when
       viewing animals. The Foreign Countries and their Governments
       manipulate and manufacture a lot of the Wars and Diseases within
       Africa.
       The Foreigners must be made in written legal binding contracts and
       with actions to reinvest in the development of African People,
       Education, Jobs and Businesses. There must be a mutual partnership
       of respect and dignity and not just foreigners depleting the Rich
       Resources of a Country.
       The U.S. corrupt souls within the 1% rich, government and Corporate
       America are now actively involved in trying to re-write history
       again because of the so called white/pale face numbers are getting
       lower in America. They want keep the number at 215 million
       white/pale, 45 million Black and 47 million Latin/Brown and 10
       million other. America is finding it hard get more pale faces
       because 3/4 of the world are people of color . In the last 40 years
       they have been all of these rich people think tank studies funded
       by rich people with corrupt souls working on how to stop the
       “Browning of America” and how the American workforce should handle
       the Browning of America. I wish I kept the article I saw from the
       think tank. I been searching because I know they put it on the
       internet.
       The real secret is they enacted Free Trade to exploit the cheap
       labor of other countries to maintain a permanent poor woking class
       in America and then claim you can’t find skilled workers or
       Americans want do the jobs. Then because this BS is repeatedly fed
       on Corporate media, people believe this stupidity
       On U.S. Employment forms today you now have choice of identifying
       your self as white/pale if you are from the “Original People” from
       North Africa (which includes Egypt), Mid East, and Europe. SMDH! I
       guess blacks can now check any and all boxes because we are the
       “original people”. Some Arabs have major skin color issues and try
       to distant themselves from Africa and prefer to be associated with
       Asia. The Asians are finally starting to show the artifacts of
       their black history hidden away for centuries. Some Arabs are
       feverishly trying to manipulate and destroy the black history in
       Egypt because their brains have been taught to hate themselves.
       Just as some Blacks in America are taught to hate themselves if
       they have darker skin. This is pure self hate which I find hard to
       understand but the psychology is interesting.
       3. U.S. Employment Forms – Race (Check all that apply)
       Check all that apply.
       American Indian or Alaska Native – a person having origins in any
       of the original peoples of North or South America (including
       Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community
       attachment.
       Asian – a person having origins in any of the original peoples of
       the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent,
       including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea,
       Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, or Vietnam.
       Black or African American – a person having origins in any of the
       black racial groups of Africa.
       Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander – a person having origins
       in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other
       Pacific islands.
       White – a person having origins in any of the original peoples of
       Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.
       The World is ¾ people of color and we aren’t going anywhere.

       “Is Ebola Coming To America?”
       It did not come 10 years ago, nor 20, nor 50, …
       Why would it come now?
       There may be a few isolated cases … there may already have been,
       simply not accurately diagnosed?
       But an epidemic?
       The obvious conclusion is there are factors in Africa unavailable
       to aid & abet the disease here. Better sanitation and hygiene may
       well be protecting us.
       Ditto for Europe et al.

       Ebola is not a death sentence but it certainly can be devastating.
       American needs to see a therapy that has worked and begin applying
       same in case there are infections
