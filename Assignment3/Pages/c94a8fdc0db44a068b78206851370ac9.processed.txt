   Since Forbes hired me in 1995 to write a legal column, I’ve taken
   advantage of the great freedom the magazine grants its staff, to pursue
   stories about everything from books to billionaires. I’ve chased South
   Africa’s first black billionaire through a Cape Town shopping mall
   while admirers flocked around him, climbed inside the hidden chamber in
   the home of an antiquarian arms and armor dealer atop San Francisco’s
   Telegraph Hill, and sipped Chateau Latour with one of Picasso’s
   grandsons in the Venice art museum of French tycoon François Pinault.
   I’ve edited the magazine’s Lifestyle section and opinion pieces by the
   likes of John Bogle and Gordon Bethune. As deputy leadership editor,
   these days I mostly write about careers and corporate social
   responsibility. I got my job at Forbes through a brilliant libertarian
   economist, Susan Lee, whom I used to put on television at
   MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour. Before that I covered law and lawyers for
   journalistic stickler, harsh taskmaster and the best teacher a young
   reporter could have had, Steven Brill.

The Cities With The Most Computer Science Jobs

   [46]The Cities With The Most Computer Science Jobs 2014

   One of the brightest spots in the employment picture for the last few
   years has been the tech job sector and the outlook remains quite sunny.
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of jobs for
   what it calls “computer and information research scientists” will
   increase by 15% between 2012 and 2022. For software developers, the
   forecast is even better, with a projected growth rate of 22%. (Compare
   that to my field: Job opportunities for a category it calls “reporters,
   correspondents and broadcast news analysts” are expected to shrink by
   13% in that period.)

   If the job outlook is strong for computer scientists nationwide, where
   are the hottest markets? I checked in with [47]Indeed, the Google-like
   job listing aggregator, to get the latest information about which
   cities have the greatest number of postings for computer science jobs
   and how those positions are paying. Salaries are good: $103,000 is the
   average pay for Senior Software Engineers, according to Indeed, one of
   the top five job titles listed, with 1,200 postings nationwide. Other
   job titles with the greatest number of listings: Software Engineer,
   Software Developer, Software Developer/Data Modeler, Software
   Development Engineer.

   When Indeed gathered its data, it counted jobs that were listed
   directly by employers as opposed to those listed by staffing firms, to
   ensure against duplicates.

   I asked Indeed to crunch numbers and come up with the 10 cities that
   have the most job listings for computer scientists. I’ve listed them
   all in the slideshow above, with the number of job listings, more than
   1,000 in each city. As they were when I wrote this story a year ago,
   computer jobs are clustered around New York, Seattle, San Francisco,
   Chicago, Houston and Austin, Texas, and the Washington, DC area. Off
   the list: Boston and Atlanta. Instead there are three new cities not
   far from DC which are rife with government jobs and/or government
   contractors—Alexandria and Herndon, VA, and Annapolis Junction, MD.

   The top city this year is, in fact, Washington, DC, up from fifth place
   last year (it was No. 1 two years ago), with a staggering 5,900
   listings on Indeed. A typical job: [48]Software Engineer in the DC
   office of $45 billion (sales) Bethesda, MD-based aerospace and defense
   contractor Lockheed Martin. The post looks challenging: the employer
   wants at least five years of experience in an alphabet soup of computer
   languages, including C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, MVC, and Web Services. The
   successful candidate must also be directed and self-disciplined.
   “Without detailed direction, plan, prepare, and complete the design of
   assigned complex components and functional systems,” reads the
   description. There is no salary posted but salary listing site
   Glassdoor pegs a software engineer’s salary at Lockheed Martin in DC
   with 4-6 years of experience, counting bonus, at $76,000. My sense it
   that the number could go higher than that, given the right fit and
   Indeed lists the majority of software engineer jobs in DC as paying
   $80,000-plus.

   The No. 2 city: Seattle, WA, home to Amazon and Microsoft, which are
   always in need of tech talent, and plenty of other firms who need
   computer scientists. In fact it’s tough to think of a company that
   doesn’t need at least a few software engineers these days. Hence the
   explosion in jobs. Number of Seattle computer science jobs listed:
   4,300. A sample Seattle job: entry-level software engineer at a “cloud
   infrastructure” startup called Igneous. This posting says the applicant
   should know at least one computer language: Java, C#, C++, Python, Ruby
   or Go, and, charmingly, asks that the applicant  want to builds systems
   that solve “meaningful, real world problems” related to data structure,
   and that they understand that the cloud is “not a magic bullet.” Again,
   no compensation is listed but salary site [49]Payscale lists average
   entry-level salaries in Seattle at $82,000. At a startup I’d imagine
   the number would be lower but still a healthy sum.

   In third place: New York, which was No. 1 last year, due, at least in
   part, to its explosion of tech startups. This year there are 3,200
   listings, including [50]Data Scientist at the Gemological Institute of
   America. The GIA wants three to five years of experience and it wants
   someone who can design algorithms to sort data. This job doesn’t
   require as sophisticated computer programming skills as the jobs listed
   above, but rather just some experience using computer analytics
   software. Again there is no salary listed but Glassdoor lists a
   Database Administrator salary of $80,000 and I’d expect a data
   scientist’s compensation to be higher.

   As I have written many times, Indeed is a good place to start a job
   search, but it’s essential to go beyond the listings if you want to
   land a job. Plug the company name into LinkedIn to learn what
   connections you have inside a company. Reach out to those people and
   ask if they know whether the job is still open and might they be able
   to meet and have a candid discussion about the company culture. It’s
   even better if they can help you get in front of the hiring manager.
   Tap the network of family and friends you see regularly and tell them
   you’re interested in the particular company.

   When you do send in your résumé, hopefully with a cover letter that
   mentions someone the recipient knows, make sure it includes keywords
   from the job description. For example, if you were applying for that
   software engineer job at Lockheed Martin you would mention that you
   know C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, MVC, and Web Services. Your letter should
   also specifically address the requirements listed in the job
   description.

   There is no question that there are plenty of computer science jobs
   waiting to be filled. Companies need to hire and they are willing to
   pay for great people.
