   Hi I'm comedian Aziz Ansari. I'm working on a book about modern romance
   and wanted to reach out to the reddit community to share their
   experiences. I've read and been told many interesting stories that I
   will be commenting on here. I'll be joined by NYU professor Eric
   Klinenberg (ericklinenberg), the author of Going Solo, who's working
   with me on the book. Thanks for your time.

   Eric and I have been doing interviews and focus groups on modern
   romance all over the US and in some other countries, too. We'd like to
   use your comments here the way we use what we learn in our other
   conversations. So any and all stories posted here may be used in our
   book.

   One more thing: I'm a comedian, so please do not mistake anything you
   read here as professional advice.

   Met a guy on okCupid who was charming and witty and looked really good
   in a suit. Found his blog and photos through mutual facebook friends,
   and I thought he was a really interesting writer. When we met for a
   date, I came in geared up for some baller tete-a-tete but then I
   realized he was just an insecure guy who'd adopted a personality shell
   of talking about cocaine and how much he hated yuppies and everything.
   Being meticulous in a written form is amazing, but meticulous in real
   life (having a carefully curated persona) is a huge turn-off.

   Being able to read what he thought about my kissing skills on his blog
   was pretty good ego-boost though.

   Yes, after meeting my now-fiance at a wedding, I looked her up on
   facebook and saw that she was out of a long-term relationship by about
   6 months or so. A lot of her photos were of her partying hard, done up
   in sequined dresses and out at night clubs.

   I prefer weekends with friends over a board game so I didn't think we'd
   have much in common.

   This led me to believe that our initial interactions were going to be
   very casual, but also made me put on my best behavior. Turns out she
   prefers nerds and that she's typically dragged to these things by her
   girlfriends. This opened the floodgates, and I opened up about my role
   playing games and video games and she shared her love for pokemon and
   sci-fi.

   After a few dates she initiated the "boyfriend/girlfriend" conversation
   and we've been together ever since.

   I'm a working lawyer and I'm single. When I online date, I look up the
   person's full name using their phone number. Then I run some searches.
   If they don't check out it saves me time. However, I did meet someone
   online and he was a doctor. I was very into him and he passed the
   online check. However, the day before the date he sent me a dick pic
   and that was the end of that.

   I don't - I feel creepy doing it. On the other hand, it's done to me
   all the time. I write for a living, and many of my articles are sex
   related. Due to this, potential dates often show signs of feeling
   intimidated. After one article I wrote about my promiscuous past gained
   significant attention, several of them mysteriously stopped talking to
   me. Their loss.

   Yes....like when you google image search their photo and find out the
   same photo surfaced in 2011 so unless they are a gargoyle they sent you
   pictures of a different girl.

   Yes. Once a guy used the wrong their/they're/there and misspelled a
   bunch of other words on his website. Full disclosure: this was actually
   after the first date, before a second one. But the first one didn't
   count as it was a grouper date and it was 3-on-3. If you aren't
   familiar, they are group dates that you get set up with by some random
   person that works at Grouper. (RIP challen.)

   On the other hand, another guy looked like he had been arrested. I
   found his mugshot... So of course I went out with him. Ugh. The appeal
   of bad boys.

   tl;dr poor grammar is unforgivable but I'll date a reformed felon.
   What's wrong with me?

   Also, if you want to let me win the lottery for your SF tickets, that's
   cool too.

   Although I am a serial monogamist, one of my best friends uses eHarmony
   in his quest to find 'the right one'. Although this fool-proof plan has
   yet to pay off for him, he has saved himself from dating a murderer.
   According to a few articles he researched online
   ([174]http://www.pitch.com/kansascity/is-esmie-evil/Content?oid=2180617
   )
   ([175]http://www.investigationdiscovery.com/tv-shows/tabloid/tabloid-vi
   deos/piano-prodigy-confesses.htm) a fellow online dater was convicted
   of killing her mother, but has since been released. What is most
   disturbing is that a fellow friend and online dater found her profile
   and wound up going on a date with her. This all happened roughly two
   years ago. The relationship is still going strong and we are all still
   too fearful to tell him that she killed her mom as a kid. This story
   goes to show that we should all do a little research before striking up
   any relationship.

   That's the great thing about Tinder; I immediately swipe left on people
   with whom I have less than three worthwhile mutual interests. I
   identify worthwhile interests as music, books and/or authors, political
   figures, and tv shows. The ones with whom I have these types of mutual
   interests I usually talk to, and occasionally meet. I get excited when
   I find someone with whom I have shared interests, and I have yet to be
   mislead or disappointed.

   I for sure look up a guy before a date--really I do it before I meet
   anyone new. I am much more comfortable meeting someone if their online
   presence matches up with what they have told me. I Google or look
   someone up on Facebook to get more information about a person for a few
   reasons: find out things to talk about and make sure they aren't a
   serial killer or have a rap sheet. What I find online is usually a
   reasonably good indicator of what they are like in person; I've learned
   to spot a douche from a mile away.

   One of my friends set me up on a blind date once with a coworker of
   his. After browsing through her Facebook profile pictures I noticed
   that they were all taken in odd angles. So right there was a huge red
   flag. I was definitely less interested in meeting with her but still
   did because well, you never know.

   When the time came to meet her the red flags I had about her ended up
   being true. She looked A LOT better in her pictures thanks to some
   magical photography angles (seriously, some of the pictures were taken
   in such odd angles, I'm pretty sure Spider-Man took them while working
   for the Daily Bugle). But, in all honesty she didn't really look like
   she did in her pictures at all in real life and I was very
   disappointed. It was overall very lame.

   This is not my story but a friend from work met a firefighter in a bar
   a few months ago. They talked a lot that night/exchanged numbers and
   were texting back and forth for the next week while setting up a first
   date. He told her he didn't have a facebook and when she mentioned that
   to some other people, they told her she should be concerned that he
   might be lying and actually have a girlfriend or be married. So she
   google searched his name + LA fire department and found that there was
   a news story on him (with a video!) about how he AND HIS MOTHER beat up
   an elderly woman who was feeding stray cats on their street. She
   immediately stopped talking to him.

   So, def do your research on people who say they don't have facebooks.
   They could be married or involved in assault cases.

   Yes.

   I met my current girlfriend through a mutual friend that I work with.
   We hit it off when we were all out at a bar one night, and after
   exchanging some texts I finally googled her name. Her career path is
   high profile, so her online presence is very professional. But after
   finding her on Facebook through our mutual friend, and seeing her
   pictures, I realized that she's just a normal girl who enjoys hiking,
   fishing, kayaking, and more. This actually set tone for me to relax a
   bit, and just be myself, since I was a little intimidated by her when
   we first met. I was feeling like she was way out of my league
   initially, but the research calmed me down.

   Things have been going great, and I really think she might just be the
   one.

   I'm kind of in two minds about researching people. On the one hand, if
   a person is an open book online and I can see their full Facebook
   profile (or their tagged photos), I'd kind of wonder what kind of
   person in this day and age doesn't know how to lock down their profile.
   I'm a very private person, and my ideal situation is one where I have
   no digital footprint, I don't know if I'd want to go out with someone
   who just put it all out there.

   On the other hand, if you can't find anything about a person, that can
   be kind of sketchy, because you're now going in blind (just like the
   good old days) and you have to wonder what they have to hide (or if
   they've given you a fake name)

   My problem is that I look quite a bit younger than I am, so the guys
   who ask me out are generally in their early 20's, and kind of too young
   for me. It's always irritating to check the Facebook profile of a guy
   I'm interested in and find out that he's 21. I've tried the whole
   "younger man" thing, it doesn't tend to work for me

   I research the shit out of people. I like to have the opportunity to
   control whether or not I end up as a skin suit. Most people I looked up
   were pretty normal. The only time I canceled was when I found charges
   of domestic violence where he beat the shit out of multiple women. I
   figured that was the universe's way of telling me to stay in and watch
   porn and do my nails. In that order.

   I cancelled a lunch date after I googled my date who had a very
   distinctive name. According to a weekly synagogue newsletter, he and
   his wife were hosting the "Teach your children the Torah class" in
   their home the same day as our date. I sent him the link. Thought
   seriously about sending his mtch.com link to the Rabbi.
