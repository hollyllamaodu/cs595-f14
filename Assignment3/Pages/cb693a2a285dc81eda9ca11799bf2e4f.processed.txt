   Hugh Herr is building the next generation of bionic limbs, robotic
   prosthetics inspired by nature's own designs. Herr lost both legs in a
   climbing accident 30 years ago; now, as the head of the MIT Media Lab’s
   Biomechatronics group, he shows his incredible technology in a talk
   that's both technical and deeply personal — with the help of ballroom
   dancer Adrianne Haslet-Davis, who lost her left leg in the 2013 Boston
   Marathon bombing, and performs again for the first time on the TED
   stage.
