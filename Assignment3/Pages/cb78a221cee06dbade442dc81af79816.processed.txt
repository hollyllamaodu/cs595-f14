   A reporter on Forbes’ wealth team, I cover (and uncover) the world’s
   1,645+ billionaires, examining how they make, spend, and give away
   their fortunes. When I’m not counting the zeros for our
   [39]Billionaires and [40]Forbes 400 lists, I’m writing about these
   entrepreneurial titans. A musician in my other life, I also co-edit
   Forbes’ [41]Hip-Hop Cash Kings and [42]Cash Princes list and have a
   penchant for turning rap lyrics into financial advice. I first joined
   Forbes as an intern in January 2012, covering startups and
   entrepreneurship. A graduate of Columbia University, I've written for
   The National newspaper in my hometown of Abu Dhabi and CNN.com in Hong
   Kong, among others. Follow me on [43]Twitter, [44]Instagram,

Into The Future: Rap's Space Cadet On Coming Down To Earth

   [54]Comment Now

   “Billionaire minds, that’s the state of mind that I’m in right now,”
   coos Nayvadius Cash, better known as Future, over the telephone from
   Atlanta, Georgia. In speech, his gravelly baritone is a tempered
   version of the impassioned autotune vocals that characterize his music,
   which spans anguished love songs and trap club bangers.

   Part rapper, part singer, Future is now a full-time alien in rap’s
   mainstream. Once relegated to the mixtape circuit, his 2014 sophomore
   effort, Honest, sold 53,000 copies in its first week, according to
   Nielsen SoundScan; this year the Southern singer even shared a track,
   “Real and True,” with pop star [56]Miley Cyrus.

   “Yesterday I spent 14 hours in the studio,” recalls Future, who says he
   recorded Honest “over 1,000” hours in New York, LA and Atlanta. “The
   studio is my comfort zone – me stepping outside it is me trying to find
   my way in the world and connecting with fans onstage is another
   comfortable moment.”

   Future played around 100 shows between June 1 2013 and June 1 2014,
   helping him to earn an estimated $2 million before taxes and fees.
   Though he’s still a few digits shy of the [57]Hip-Hop Cash Kings, the
   30-year-old Epic signee may be on his way to stratospheric heights,
   thanks in part to collaborations with producers like Mike Will Made It,
   who executive produced Honest and worked on hit “[58]Move [59]Move That
   Dope.”

   “I met Future around 2010,” recalls Mike Will, real name Michael
   Williams, who was responsible for over $9.8 million worth of singles
   sold in 2013 alone. “I really believed in 2 Chainz, I really believed
   in Future, and I was going to the studio with them every single day.”

   “His production is one thing but his ear and opinion and creativity –
   we always work hand in hand,” says Future of Mike Will, whose
   production also graced Future’s 2012 debut, Pluto. “Mike Will played
   Pharrell the record and he gravitated towards it. We’ve been fans
   growing up listening to Pusha T and Pharrell, so to have them on “Move
   That Dope” was a class moment for me in my career.”

   Yet beyond the narcotic references and flashy guest features, Future’s
   greatest strength is his ability to appear vulnerable lyrically. “I
   think of myself as someone who is versatile and I don’t mind showcasing
   the person I am,” says Future, whose volatile relationship with singer
   Ciara has consistently covered column inches.  [61]“I’ve got to step
   outside hip-hop’s comfort zone at times to make great music.”

   For Future, oftentimes that means going into orbit. Like fellow space
   cadet [62]Kanye West - who can forget “Spaceship” and the intergalactic
   Glow in the Dark tour – Future has long had his head in the clouds.
   Dubbed “the future” by his cousin Rico Wade and members of the Dungeon
   Family (Outkast is an affiliate) he seems to be living up to his
   moniker. “Words are powerful,” Future reflects. “I started feeling that
   future was the way for me – I get the chance to prove myself over and
   over, time and again, to not be a trendsetter but a trailblazer.”

   Today, the influence of his clipped flow on songs like “Sh!t” and
   upspeak style on “My” can be heard in the styling of rising MCs Young
   Thug and Rich Homie Quan, while the rapper-or-singer conundrum Future
   proliferated continues to resonate in artists like Chance the Rapper.

   “Every young guy that’s coming up, I salute them. [63]Be consistent,
   love what you do and it’ll work out,”  says Future, speaking to
   up-and-coming rappers. “My hat’s off to those guys working hard to make
   hits and change the lives of the people around them.”

   As for Nayvadius Cash – what motivates him? “My kids, my family keep me
   going; my passion for music is always going to keep me going,” says
   Future. “I feel like I’m changing lives for the better. Even though
   certain situations might be negative, I help you overcome anything
   you’re going through. I might not be going through it still to this day
   but I’m speaking from past experience and they get a chance to see
   where I’m at right now and they can overcome and get through it.”
