     * [49]Film screenings for Women's Equality Day

       working families and discussed ways to help them succeed.

       To honor Women's Equality Day on August 26th, OFA held 38 local
       events across the country bringing volunteers together to watch
       [52]Paycheck to Paycheck: The Life and Times of Katrina Gilbert.

       The documentary, produced by HBO Documentary Films in association
       with [57]The Shriver Report follows Katrina Gilbert, a certified
       nursing assistant, as she navigates the challenges of arranging
       child care, dealing with an ongoing medical condition, and trying
       to make ends meet on just $9.49 an hour.
       After watching Katrina's story, OFA volunteers discussed the film,
       and what we can do to take action to help give families like hers
       the economic security they deserve. At a screening in Denver,
       attendees shared their own stories, such as one supporter who is a
       financial planner as well as a single parent and is living paycheck
       to paycheck himself.

       OFA-NY Team Harlem Chapter Lead Ny Whitaker told the crowd, "We
       stand here today on the shoulders of the women and the men who had
       the vision to fight for equality long before the world was ready. I
       never would have thought that in 2014 this would still be an issue,
       but I am calling upon each of you to help us continue to fight for
       equality for women here in New York City and everywhere."

     John's enthralled. Grew up in Chattanooga where "Paycheck to
     Paycheck" takes place. [65]#OFAugust [66]@OFA_CA [67]@OFAPalmSprings

       Katrina's story in Paycheck to Paycheck represents challenges faced
       by more than 42 million American women and the 28 million children
       who depend on them. [70]Join the conversation and stand with women
