   When Bran Ferren was just 9, his parents took him to see the Pantheon
   in Rome — and it changed everything. In that moment, he began to
   understand how the tools of science and engineering become more
   powerful when combined with art, with design and beauty. Ever since,
   he's been searching for a convincing modern-day equivalent to Rome's
   masterpiece. Stay tuned to the end of the talk for his unexpected
   suggestion.
