   I am currently the Chief Medical Officer for AVIA, a Chicago-based
   company that works with health care providers, entrepreneurs and
   capital to accelerate the adoption of new technologies and solutions. I
   enjoyed a long career in patient care – with time on staff at the
   University of Pennsylvania, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
   Cancer Center and Baylor Scott & White Healthcare. I have also been a
   funded molecular therapeutics biomedical investigator, a medical school
   department chair and health system strategist. I have written and
   published extensively in the academic and lay press - on topics related
   to biomedical research, medical history and education, the human side
   of health care, and clinical care delivery. My goal is to encourage
   more thoughtful discourse encouraging positive change in the complex
   medical, social and financial enterprise that is American medicine.

Delivering Health Care By Drone

     “We may very well stand at one of those decisive turning points in
     history that separate whole eras from each other.  For
     contemporaries entangled, as we are, in the inexorable demands of
     daily life, the dividing lines between eras may be hardly visible
     when crossed; only after people stumble over them do the lines grow
     into wall which irretrievably shut off the past.”

     -Hannah Arendt


   I once asked a clinical colleague to describe what it had been like
   working as a trainee with a world-famous surgeon.

   His response was surprising, and troubling – “Oh… he’s brilliant and
   talented, of course, but to be honest – he’s dangerous.  He has become
   more or less indifferent to patient suffering, and even death – I guess
   because he has seen so much of it.”

   Although infrequent, this type of desensitization, or inurement,
   unfortunately does occur in clinical settings – whereby health care
   workers that are constantly exposed to suffering become “numbed” to it
   over time.

   Hannah Arendt, the German-American philosopher, coined the term
   [47]“banality of evil” in her New Yorker series covering the Nazi war
   criminal trial of Adolph Eichmann – suggesting that blind allegiance to
   authority can lead to indifference to suffering.  Although she was
   aggressively criticized by many for implying an apology for the Third
   Reich’s role in the Holocaust, those investigating the topic (most
   notably [48]Stanley Milgram in his experimentsillustrating that college
   students, given the instructions to shock others by an authority figure
   will do so repeatedly) have supported her theory.

   Despite the fact that desensitization, and the “Milgram” effect are
   real, what I am really concerned about in health care at this
   particular “decisive turning point in history” is neither of these –
   what worries me is “distance.”

   Could the use of technologies that distance health care providers from
   the first-hand experience of the suffering of those they care for (such
   as telemedicine platforms and other forms of “virtual visits” or
   self-care tools) lead to a collective “stumbling over lines” with
   unfortunate consequences?  On one side of these lines is empathy and
   understanding of the nature of suffering, and on the other, a loss of
   that perspective.

   I recently spoke with Dr. Eric Cassell – a pioneer in the development
   of the specialty of [49]Palliative Care.  He wrote a landmark article
   published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1982, entitled “The
   Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine,” and later edited a
   well-respected textbook by the same name.  We discussed both the
   possibility that technology could increasingly distance providers from
   suffering, and the fact that many physicians are “burning out” in a
   time when technology should actually be making their jobs easier.

   “They are related,” he said. “The problem that physicians have now is
   not that they get too close to their patients, but that they do not get
   close enough… The suffering have special therapeutic needs, and those
   aren’t met by technology alone.”

   Dr. Rushika Fernandapulle, the co-founder and CEO of [50]Iora Health, a
   company that is growing a new model for primary care delivery
   leveraging high tech and high touch, shared his thoughts.

   “The thing that heals people is relationships – the problem is that
   technology has the ability to actually facilitate relationships, but it
   can also get in the way of them.”

   Karl Marlantes’ book about his experiences in Vietnam as a young
   soldier, “[51]What it is Like to Go to War” examines the social and
   psychological consequences of fighting, killing and returning from
   those experiences, and provides an interesting analogy.  He asserts
   that the contemporary use of drones and cruise missiles, and the lack
   of subsequent exposure to the suffering and damage that these weapons
   cause – may have important unintended consequences.

   “Death becomes an abstraction, except for those at the receiving end,”
   he says. “What is at stake is not only the psyche of each young
   fighter, but our humanity… the chances for transformational
   psychological experiences are decreased enormously when you wage war
   with all the comforts of home.  You have no way of knowing if you are
   in the sacred space of Mars and death, or coming home from it.”

   Mars was the Roman god of war, and the Romans believed that Mars
   sanctioned war only as a means to achieve peace.  In the spirit of this
   ancient viewpoint, Marlantes implies that for one to “enter the Temple
   of Mars” that he must understand fully (experience) the consequences of
   his actions, and only seek war as a means to more humane ends.
   Although the latter may be achieved with war from a distance, the
   former simply cannot.

   The adoption and deployment of next generation technologies made
   possible by the digital revolution – those that move the locus of care
   closer to the patient, and “extend” the care capabilities of providers
   in a number of ways will be absolutely essential to improve the
   delivery of care.
   However, as we use these new tools, let us take care to not allow them
   to create “walls difficult to traverse” between those that are
   providing care, and those that are suffering.  Let us continue to
   immerse ourselves in the nature of suffering of the diseases we treat,
   as well as the suffering that is often created by our efforts to treat
   them.  We must avoid, at all costs, simply delivering health care by
   drone.
