How Parents Can Hedge Against Rising Tuition Prices

   [44]Comment Now
   [45]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Trying to figure out what tuition will cost 18 years from now when your
   newborn baby is ready for college can be as difficult as saving the
   money itself. So what can you do to guarantee the money you’ll save
   will actually help your child get through college? Invest in prepaid
   tuition plans.

   What are prepaid tuition plans?

   Prepaid tuition plans are a special kind of 529 plan, a tax-advantaged
   college investment plan where you purchase tomorrow’s tuition at
   today’s prices. There are two basic places you can purchase future
   tuition: from your state if they offer a prepaid option or from
   [46]Private College 529 Plan, which works with 275 private colleges.
   The state plans will generally offer guaranteed tuition options for
   state schools. However, there is generally an option for redeeming
   tuition units or credits at out-of-state and private schools. For
   instance, [47]Washington State would allow you to choose a private
   school and deduct the amount of the U[48]niversity of Washington’s
   tuition and then you pay the difference. Some states such as
   Pennsylvania even have specific private college plans for their
   residents.

   Who can participate?

   To find out if your state offers a prepaid tuition plan, go to the
   [49]collegesavings.org website and select your state. You’ll see if
   there is a prepaid option in your state. If you’re state doesn’t offer
   one, don’t worry. You still may have options. States will often let you
   purchase their plan if a grandparent or divorced parent lives in that
   state. Check individual plan guidelines. Anyone, no matter what state
   they live in, qualifies for Private College 529 Plan.

   How much do you need to invest?

   It sounds great and all to purchase tomorrow’s tuition at today’s
   prices, but how many parents have a spare $10,000 in their bank
   accounts? Not many, but the good news is they don’t need it. Private
   College 529 Plan allows parents to buy in with as little as $500 over a
   2-year period. That’s about $21 per month. But will that amount buy you
   much tuition? Not really, at least not if you never increase the amount
   you put in.

   However, let’s say you start off by just investing $25 per month for
   the first two years of a child’s life. Then, yay, no more diapers! You
   increase contributions by another $60 to $85 per month until the child
   is 5. Once your kindergartner no longer needs daycare, you throw in
   $200 per month of what you were spending on childcare to total a $285
   monthly contribution. This plan, according to Nancy Farmer, president
   of Private College 529 Plan would help a student acquire two and two
   thirds years of prepaid tuition at their least expensive private
   college. At [50]Baylor, a student would have just over a year of
   prepaid tuition purchased.

   In comparison, in [51]Washington State  a parent could purchase 50
   semester units for a newborn at $74 per month for 18 years. 50 semester
   units is half a year at the state’s most expensive college, which is
   currently the University of Washington. Then when the child is 5,
   parents could purchase another 150 semester units, a year and a half
   years at the state’s most expensive school, for $260 per month. The
   total tuition purchase would be 2 years, less tuition than what someone
   could buy  for about the same money at the least expensive school in
   the Private College 529 Plan program. However, a parent could redeem
   the tuition at a regional college instead and get the same two and two
   thirds years of tuition covered for the least expensive school in the
   Private College 529 Plan.

   How do parents make up the difference in the total price of tuition for
   four years of college? Parents may send their children to community
   colleges for a year or two and then use prepaid tuition for the final
   years. Their child may also get scholarships or grants that make up the
   difference. Minimal student loan borrowing may also be the final
   funding source.

   Bottomline

   In the battle to pay for a child’s college education prepaid tuition
   plans are one potential resource families can use. However, paying for
   college for most parents takes strategic planning involving a variety
   of funding sources. Families should look at all their options and
   combinations of options.

       Just parents?? How about aunts, uncles, cousins, employers,
       neighbors….ALL should fall under the collegiate income purview,
       right??
       Think about this: there are many, many colleges out there charging
       32k to 66k per year for all-up costs…and they can do that ONLY
       because they know they can coerce parents and the kids can get
       loans.
       This system is wacked.

       Neutral, you just need to know where the value is in the world of
       colleges and universities. They may “charge” that much but
       typically you don’t pay that much. Need based aid and/or merit aid
       can cut that down substantially. If not and money is an issue, look
       elsewhere.

       Great point. Gifting 529 plan money by extended family and friends
       is becoming a huge trend.

       Prepaid tuition plans sound like a great strategy plan, especially
       if one uses it for the last two years while attending a community
       college for the first two. However, what about inflation and the
       costs of college continuously rising? Would it be better to take
       that money and invest in a mutual fund or commodities, so that when
       the child is 18 and ready to attend college their net worth has
       increased, overtime, instead of decreased?

       The Private College 529 Plan is great but I use it in a different
       way. I took money I had saved in accounts with more growth than
       average tuition rate hikes. Once I got within 3 years of her
       starting college, I moved it to the Private College 529 Plan. I did
       this at that time for these reasons…
       1. The money needs to be in the plan for 36 months before taken
       out.
       2. I wanted a conservative investment strategy for those last 3
       years. Markets can tank and not recover within 3 years.
       3. The rate of return averages 4-6% per year tax free guaranteed.
       Where else are you going to beat that?
       4. If you don’t attend one of those schools, you get +- 2% per year
       added to principle. Still better than CDs or short term bonds.
       If I had young children, I would wait before putting money into
       this plan. If tuition inflation slows down to 2% or so, other
       assets investments may beat that, substantially. I’ve seen some
       school’s rate already slowing down due to out pricing the market.
       PS – I do college advising so I’ve done a lot of research.
