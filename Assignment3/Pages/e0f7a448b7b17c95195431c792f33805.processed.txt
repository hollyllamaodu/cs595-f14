   Is there more than one universe? In this visually rich, action-packed
   talk, Brian Greene shows how the unanswered questions of physics
   (starting with a big one: What caused the Big Bang?) have led to the
   theory that our own universe is just one of many in the "multiverse."

   [82]Brian Greene
   Physicist
   Brian Greene is perhaps the best-known proponent of superstring theory,
   the idea that minuscule strands of energy vibrating in a higher
   dimensional space-time create every particle and force in the universe.
