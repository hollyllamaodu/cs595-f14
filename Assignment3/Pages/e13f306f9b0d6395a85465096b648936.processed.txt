Will NFL's Tax-Exempt Status Sustain Attack By Members Of Congress?

   [48]Comment Now
   [49]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   The National Football League is currently dealing with a major public
   relations crisis.  It relates to the serious matters concerning violent
   behavior exhibited by [50]Ray Rice, [51]Adrian Peterson and other
   professional athletes, along with a lingering dispute over the
   continued usage of “Redskins” by the NFL franchise in [52]Washington
   D.C.  The public outcry for change in policies has led to [53]some
   legislators calling for the curtailing of the NFL’s long-held
   tax-exempt status.  Here is why the NFL is unlikely to be stripped of
   its tax-exempt status, and even if it does have to pay taxes, the
   revenues generated therefrom will be insignificant.

   Why doesn’t the NFL have to pay taxes?

   The NFL is considered a not-for-profit business league and has received
   an exemption from paying federal income taxes under section 501(c)(6)
   of the Internal Revenue Code.  Section 501(c) provides a list of
   organizations (by type) that may earn such an exemption from taxation.
    The particular subsection under which the NFL has earned its
   tax-exempt status carves out “[b]usiness leagues, chambers of commerce,
   real-estate boards, boards of trade, or professional football leagues
   (whether or not administering a pension fund for football players), not
   organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to
   the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.”  The NFL’s
   tax-exempt status is further recognized by the Third Circuit in the
   case of Mid-S. Grizzlies v. Nat’l Football League, 720 F.2d 772 (3d
   Cir. 1983).

   Why do NFL teams have to pay taxes?

   Quite simply, they are not included within the carve out provided
   by section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.  While there is a
   specific reference to “professional football leagues,” there is no
   similar treatment for NFL franchises.  Each NFL team is a for-profit
   franchise in the form of a corporation, partnership, sole
   proprietorship or another form of corporate entity.  Teams control
   their ticket prices, player and coach salaries, stadium leases, etc.
   Whereas the NFL has been deemed to be an unincorporated association,
   each NFL team is viewed as a separate for-profit entity, thus subject
   to taxation.

   [54]A photo of the Logo of the National Football L...

   Is there a real legal justification for voiding the NFL’s tax-exempt
   status?

   It is somewhat curious that section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue
   Code, which is not a lengthy provision, contains an explicit carve out
   for professional football leagues.  If such a carve out were to be
   removed, the analysis concerning whether the NFL should retain its
   tax-exempt status would likely rest on a review of its role as a
   “business league.”  The general rule is that a “business league” is
   “an association of persons having some common business interest, the
   purpose of which is to promote such common interest and not to engage
   in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit . . .
   [I]ts activities should be directed to the improvement of business
   conditions of one or more lines of business as distinguished from the
   performance of particular services for individual persons.  An
   organization whose purpose is to engage in a regular business of a kind
   ordinarily carried on for profit, even though the business is conducted
   on a cooperative basis or produces only sufficient income to be
   self-sustaining, is not a business league.”

   As is commonly the case, it is difficult to peg the NFL as either a
   business league or better resembling a for-profit entity.  The NFL
   ostensibly has a common business interest (to promote the individual
   teams, increase revenues across the board, maintain safe playing
   conditions, etc.); however, it also appears to be engaging in a regular
   business ordinarily carried on for profit (i.e. negotiating major
   television-rights deals with a variety of national networks).

   Where the Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Washington Redskins public
   relations dilemmas meet the law is in the section of the “business
   league” definition that reads, “its activities should be directed to
   the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business
   as distinguished from the performance of particular services for
   individual persons.”  Legislators may point to that provision and claim
   that the NFL is not doing its job to improve business conditions, and
   instead, has acted in a way that negatively affects such conditions.
   The [55]NFL’s concussion crisis could be another point of emphasis for
   those seeking to void the NFL’s longstanding tax-exempt status.

   Yet, the NFL will fall back on the exemption for “professional football
   leagues” found within section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.
   The fact that the NFL is a professional football league will not be
   enough to pass scrutiny.  If called to task, the NFL will still be
   forced to show that it is not organized for profit and that no part of
   its net earnings inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or
   individual.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell [56]earns $44 million per
   year.  That may be a good starting point for such an inquiry.

   So will the NFL be paying taxes anytime soon?

   Probably not.  The latest surge of discussion among members of Congress
   appears to be more of a public relations ploy on their end than
   anything else.  They have noticed the immense amount of attention that
   the Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Washington Redskins matters have
   attracted in recent weeks and may believe that by taking a strong
   stance (i.e. supporting the revocation of the NFL’s tax-exempt status)
   they will get their names in front of the public on an issue that many
   will support.  The general public will question why the NFL, an
   “unincorporated association” of football teams, is [57]earning roughly
   $9.5 billion in revenue per year, yet paying no taxes on same (even
   though individual teams that receive the bulk of that money are paying
   taxes).  Further, the legislators may believe it is hard to lose by
   taking a position against the NFL, which has been embroiled in
   controversy as of late.

   However, as noted above, the NFL has a very unique carve out in section
   501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Further, teams do pay taxes on
   the revenue they receive from the league.  The likelihood for change
   may not be on the horizon despite the amount of attention the NFL’s
   curious tax-exempt status has received in recent days.  That said,
   recent controversy aside, it may be time for Congress to seriously look
   into whether there is cause to terminate the NFL’s tax-exempt status.

   As the Ninth Circuit stated in Retailers Credit Ass’n. v. Commissioner,
   9 Cir., 90 F.2d 47, 50, 111 A.L.R. 152, “There is no special
   significance to the words ‘business League.‘  All business leagues are
   not exempt . . . [o]nly those having particular purposes, which do not
   have the prohibited purposes, and which operate in the prescribed way
   are exempt.”  Similarly, not all professional football leagues are
   exempt.  Will the NFL be tested?

   Finally, will it matter if the NFL is stripped of its special status?
   Barely, if at all.  Call it crafty accounting if you wish, but in
   recent years the NFL has reported [58]on its tax returns that it
   operates at a loss.  Even if the league is forced to change around its
   accounting practices, it will likely still fail to show a significant
   net income for the purpose of taxation.  If the NFL, along with
   tax-exempt National Hockey League and PGA Tour, were to be taxed, it
   would probably result in a total windfall of [59]roughly $10 million
   per year.

   Thus, this latest challenge to the NFL’s tax-exempt status appears to
   be more of a political maneuver to gain favor with constituents then a
   real cause for change concerning NFL taxation.
