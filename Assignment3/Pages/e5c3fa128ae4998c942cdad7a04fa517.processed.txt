Defining Modern IT: The 21st Century CIO

   [45]Thornton May [46]Thornton May , SungardAS

   As an anthropologist studying the behavior of the various tribes
   operating in the contemporary workplace I observe evolving patterns of
   word use, abuse and non-use. I was very surprised to discover that just
   about EVERY discipline [e.g., art, literature, theatre, politics,
   marketing, publishing, entertainment and finance] extensively and
   intensively make use of the word “modern”. The only discipline where
   the word “modern” is conspicuously absent is IT.

   I found it paradoxical that the discipline heretofore thought
   responsible for creating/managing/deploying the myriad technologies
   which essentially form the backdrop of the modern world for the most
   part, does not use the word “modern” and is not perceived as being
   modern. Indeed, in many instances IT and enterprise IT practitioners
   are considered embarrassingly out of date. For many next generation
   knowledge workers, entering the workplace often feels like entering a
   computer science museum.  In the minds of most millennials, enterprise
   IT is decidedly not-modern.

   How does one define modern IT or the modern CIO? Turns out the
   definitions are rather hard to come by…

   Working with the CIOs at the [49]University of Kentucky
   [[50]http://goo.gl/5K6UI], the Olin College of Engineering
   [[51]http://goo.gl/yM7cV4] and THE Ohio State University
   [[52]http://goo.gl/GHDGCS] I have, over the past three years,
   systematically studied the State of the Modern IT Organization. Our
   ongoing research focuses on understanding how IT leaders,
   professionals, and organizations are striving to re-label themselves as
   “modern.”

   In a series of exercises conducted with executives around the world I
   asked three questions:

   1. What does/should a “modern” IT Organization look like?

   2. What elements define the “modern” CIO?

   3. What differentiates a “modern” CIO from a non-modern CIO?

   A consensus answer regarding what “modern” means in an IT context was
   not forthcoming. In a workshop at The Ohio State University we asked
   100 senior IT executives what they thought “modern” IT, the IT of the
   future would look like. The responses covered a broad spectrum ranging
   from those envisioning “IT becoming a dictator” [i.e., becoming
   aggressive, disregarding existing boundaries and grabbing for control]
   and those who believe that IT will lose its independent identity and
   become invisible. I am in the process of deciphering what these diverse
   and polarized opinions mean for the future of IT. One pattern which did
   emerge was that while people could not unambiguously say what “modern”
   IT was. They could tell you – emphatically – what not-modern IT was.

   Not-Modern IT

   One of the areas where it was quite easy to differentiate between
   modern and non-modern IT behaviors was in attitude toward new
   technology. In the 1980s a mentor of mine created a caricature of the
   CIO persona named Garzog. Garzog had a stick – a baseball bat with a
   spike in the end. My mentor assured clients that Garzog actually
   represented the mindset of many CIOs he was interviewing at the time.
   The technology adoption issue of the day in the 80s was PCs.  Garzog
   would patrol the corridors of the workplace shouting, “You bring me the
   damn user that’s got a PC. I will crush their skull.” This aggressively
   non-user centric, “My Way or the Highway” approach to technology
   adoption is now unanimously considered non-modern IT behavior.

   Dan Lohrmann is a close friend and a fine executive. For thirteen years
   he was the Chief Information [53]Security Officer [CISO] for the State
   of Michigan. He is now Chief Strategist and Chief Security Officer at
   Security Mentor. I asked Dan to share his thoughts about the
   modern/not-modern divide in IT. He instantly recalled a foundational
   moment in his career. It was 2004. Dan was the CISO for the state. He
   was six months into building a relationship with the new state CIO,
   Teri Takai. Teri is one of the most respected modern CIOs in the world
   today. Following her tenure at the State of Michigan she went on to
   become the CIO at the State of California [IT budget ~$5 billion] and
   then CIO at the Department of Defense [IT budget ~$35 billion].

   In 2004, one of the top topics in technology was wireless – Wi Fi. The
   organization wanted to put Wi Fi in all the conference rooms. Dan was
   the security guy. He did all his homework. He discovered that just
   about all the headlines at the time – like today – revolved around
   “HACKING!” Somebody had hacked into a BIG Box store network via Wi Fi
   while sitting in car in the parking lot. Dan collected all the White
   Papers. He documented ALL the reasons why his organization shouldn’t do
   Wi Fi – Why Wi Fi was a bad idea for the State of Michigan.

   Around this time the new CIO convened a big leadership meeting. At one
   point in the meeting Teri said, “Dan, what is the plan to get Wi Fi
   from a security perspective – the team wants to work with you to get
   this in all the conference rooms?” Dan said to Teri, “Teri, we can’t do
   this project. We can’t do Wi Fi. Security is vetoing this project.”

   There was a gasp and then the entire room went silent. Dan remembers,
   “You could have cut the air with a knife.” Teri said, “I would like
   everyone to leave the room but Dan.” Everyone quickly left the room.
   Dan had been working with Teri for maybe six months. [They are today
   best friends]. In 2004, in that now empty conference room Teri said,
   “Dan, if that is your answer, you can’t be the CISO for the State of
   Michigan.” Dan said, “What?” He was freaking out. He was the guy who
   had received “Excellent” on every performance appraisal for the past 20
   years. Teri continued, “I have just been to Dow, Ford and Chrysler.
   They all have Wi Fi in THEIR conference rooms. What do they know that
   you don’t know? Go figure it out in a week if you want to keep your
   job.”

   Dan kept his job. Two years later the State of Michigan was to receive
   multiple awards for their wireless programs.

   The moral of this story is that saying “No” is not a modern IT
   behavior. Figuring out how to move forward is a modern – perhaps the
   most modern IT behavior.

       My philosophy on IT is we will embrace the cloud services, apps,
       and devices that help employees do their jobs. Employees should be
       able to use the apps necessary to get their jobs done, so if there
       is a need for certain apps, then IT should provide access to that
       app, not block it. I view Shadow IT as an opportunity to understand
       what our users’ needs are and how we can better support them by
       improving the service we deliver.
       Whenever we can, we strive to be an IT department that says, “Yes,”
       instead of, “No.” Our mindset is, “How do we help? How can we make
       this work for you?” not “How do we block it?” When we do
       occasionally have to say, “No,” for security or other reasons, our
       customers take us seriously because they will see us as their
       partner, rather than their adversary.
