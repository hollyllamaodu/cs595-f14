14 things every Galaxy S5 owner should do

   Buying a new phone can be rough. With a fancy new user interface
   usually comes hundreds of software features and you may not have the
   slightest clue where to start. Don’t worry. Your friends at Phandroid
   got your back.
   [INS: :INS]

   In this post, we’ll be exploring the first things you should be doing
   with your phone as a brand new [20]Samsung Galaxy S5 owner.

            Read: [21]Official Hands-on of the Samsung GALAXY S5

                [22]14 things every Galaxy S5 owner should do

Security

1. Setup fingerprint scanner (and make it work with 1-hand)

   [23]Galaxy S5 Fingerprint scanner

   Because your smartphone holds a heap ton of personal information, your
   first act of business should be securing your phone. Whether you want
   to do that with a password (high security), pin (medium security), or
   pattern, the Samsung Galaxy S5 makes this process a little less painful
   with the inclusion of a fingerprint scanner in the home button.

   Executed with a simple swipe, that’s all you’ll need to unlock your
   phone and keep unwanted eyes out. Simply open up the Settings app, then
   scroll down and select “Fingerprint.” Choose the top option “Use
   fingerprint recognition…” and from there, you’ll be walked through
   setting up the fingerprint scanner.

   Protip: Samsung’s way isn’t the only way to register a print. Instead,
   try hold the phone naturally with 1 hand, and swipe at an angle with
   your thumb. This will ensure you can easily unlock your phone using 1
   hand, instead of 2 like in Samsung’s demo. A hundred times more
   convenient. Don’t forget that you register up to 3 fingerprints, so
   feel free to register more prints using the 2-handed method as well.

2. Setup your lock screen with owner information

   [24]Galaxy S5 lockscreen info

   Now that your phone is secure and you’ve effectively guaranteed nobody
   will make it past your lockscreen, now would be a good time to set up
   your lockscreen with some helpful contact information. This will ensure
   that, in the event you ever lose your phone, a good Samaritan will have
   all the info they need to contact and return it to you safely.

Make things easier to find

3. Change settings to list view

   [25]Galaxy S5 Settings list view

   Samsung kinda threw everyone for a loop when they introduced their new
   Settings layout for the Galaxy S5. Instead of the normal list we’ve
   been since Android 1.0, they’ve gone ahead and chosen a grid layout.
   Cluttered and difficult to find what you’re looking for — don’t worry,
   there’s an easy way to get the traditional list view back. Simply press
   the 3-dot menu button in the upper right corner, and select “List
   view.” Now you can enjoy Settings options that are now 100% easier to
   find than before.

4. Customize notification area

   [INS: :INS]

   [26]Galaxy S5 notification panel

   Probably the most important part of your phone’s user interface is the
   notification area. Pull it down and you’ll notice handy shortcuts at
   the top of the phone to quickly toggle commonly used functions like
   WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.. Samsung’s layout may not be the most ideal (it
   really isn’t), but you can customize all the little toggles that show
   up, not only when your first pull down the notification panel, but in
   the secondary area as well (see picture 1).

   We recommend getting rid of things you never use often (like screen
   rotation or location), and replacing it with Power saver, multi-view,
   and toolbox — handy features you’ll need quick access to. Everything
   else, just organize and place below the first row of the “active
   buttons” section. With so many options, it’s worth taking a minute to
   set up this portion of your Galaxy S5.

5. Customize Toolbox

   [27]Galaxy S5 Toolbox tips

   The Toolbox is a floating button of sorts that when enabled, can give
   you shortcuts to apps you use often. Useful for quickly jumping to apps
   without even having to visit your homescreen, this too can be custom
   tailored to suit your tastes.

   Simply open up the Toolbox option from the Settings app, turn it on,
   and click the “edit” key to add which ever apps you like. When turned
   on, you can quickly summon the Toolbox by simply long pressing the back
   key on your phone.

6. Customize Multi-window

   [28]Galaxy S5 Multi-window

   It’s probably the coolest software feature found on the Galaxy S5, and
   can be hugely beneficial to power users: multi-window. A TouchWiz
   feature that allows you to use 2 applications simultaneously, this too
   will take some setting up for maximum effectiveness.

   Aside from customizing the drawer with apps you’d like to use along
   with other apps, you can even setup group shortcuts by clicking on the
   “create” option towards the bottom of the window. Our favorite group?
   YouTube/Hangouts for watching videos and chatting with friends at the
   same time. Fun.

7. Turn on NFC

   [INS: :INS]

   [29]Galaxy S5 NFC

   NFC — or Near Field Communication — is one of the best things about
   owning a modern smartphone. Located on the back of your smartphone,
   there’s a tiny chip that is only activated when in very close proximity
   to a reader.

   With NFC, you can tap 2 phones together (providing it too is
   NFC-enabled), send photos via Bluetooth, or pair your phone to
   something like a Bluetooth speaker, even make purchases at 7-Eleven
   using your phone (providing you’ve set up Tap and Pay with Google
   Wallet or alternative payment methods). Just make sure that once you
   turn NFC on, don’t forget to also turn on Android Beam and S Beam for
   full functionality.

   Best part about NFC is doesn’t have any impact on battery life, so you
   don’t have to worry about leaving it on.

Make your phone feel faster

8. Turn off animations inside hidden Developer options

   [30]Galaxy S5 Developer Options animations

   I talked about this briefly in my Galaxy S5 rant, but one thing some
   users might notice when using the phone is a slight amount of lag when
   opening apps. Whether this has something to do with TouchWiz or
   hardware, you can help “speed” things up by turning off all animations
   in the phone.

   The only way to do this is to enable super top secret “Developer
   options” hidden in your Galaxy S5. This is done by opening up the
   Settings app, scrolling down to “About device,” then pressing on Build
   Number a total of 7 times. You’ll see a toast notification letting you
   know how many presses you are away from “becoming a developer.”

   Once you’re done, return to the main Settings area and scroll to the
   bottom. There you’ll find a new option for Developer options. Once
   inside, scroll down to “Transition animation scale,” and set everything
   to 0 for a really quick feel (or simply 5.x to speed things up a little
   bit). Enjoy!

9. Turn off S Voice

   [31]Galaxy S5 S Voice

   Out of the box, your Samsung Galaxy S5 features a short cut to quickly
   open up S Voice, Samsung’s own virtual voice assistant app. Because the
   app is sorta redundant, you may want to stick with Google Search which
   we’ve found to work better all around (executed by long pressing the
   home button).

   Not only do we never feel the need to quickly access S Voice (you can
   always find it in your app drawer), but it can actually slow your roll.
   How? When the shortcut is enabled (executed by pressing the home button
   twice), your phone will always wait for a second key press, every time
   you simply want to return to your home screen. Some might not even
   notice the delay, but for those looking to increase the speed and
   responsiveness of their $600 investment, just turn the dang shortcut
   off.

   You can do this simply by opening up the S Voice application, going
   into its settings by clicking the 3-dot menu in the upper right. Then
   scroll down to “Open via home key” and turn it off (uncheck the box).
   Boom. Another laggy shortcut disabled.

Power management

10. Adjust Power saving mode

   [32]Galaxy S5 Power Saving Mode

   The Galaxy S5 features a hand-dandy “Power saving” mode, but like most
   things, it will take some tweaking to suit your needs. For instance, by
   default, power saving mode goes all out, blocking background data,
   slowing down performance (making the phone slower when scrolling
   through menus), and finally, can make your phone display only grayscale
   (black and white).

   Altogether, these are pretty extreme measure to simply squeeze a little
   bit of extra battery life from your phone. Because of the amount of
   messaging applications that rely on background data to function — apps
   like Hangout, Facebook Messenger, Kik, etc. — we don’t think turning
   off background data is worth the trade off.

   Instead, options like restricting performance and grayscale mode will
   allow you to use your phone as normal, while ensuring your Galaxy S5 is
   using only a minimal amount of battery while being used. I mean, you
   don’t need color or a silky smooth UI to chat with friends or send a
   tweet, right?

11. Turn off touch key lights

   [INS: :INS]

   [33]Galaxy S5 Touch key light duration

   Because even LED lights can drain your smartphone’s battery, turning
   off the LEDs that light up the multitasking and back buttons could help
   conserve precious juice. One of the coolest parts about the Galaxy S5
   is they actually give you the ability to turn them off.

   Simply head to your Settings app, scroll to the Display option, then
   select Touch hey light duration and switch it to “Always off.”
   Hopefully you don’t forget where those keys are located in the dark
   (but we think you’ll be just fine).

12. Black out your lock screen

   [34]Galaxy S5 black lockscreen

   When you first get your phone, we’re sure the first thing you noticed
   was that intense lockscreen. Earlier in this post we told you how you
   could/should add your contact information in the event you lose your
   phone, and now we’re going to talk about how to tweak it for battery
   life.

   The Galaxy S5 features a unique Super AMOLED display and without
   getting too technical, that means unlike traditional LCD, the Galaxy S5
   doesn’t require much juice to light up the black pixels on the phone (I
   mean, they’re already black, right?). What that also means is if you
   use a black background on your lock screen, your phone only has to
   light up the time, date, and other small text. Problem is, Samsung
   doesn’t supply an all black wallpaper, so you’re going to have to find
   your own. Don’t worry, you can click [35]here for one.

   Once downloaded, head into your Settings, and jump into Wallpaper,
   click Lock screen, and select “more images” from the wallpaper chooser,
   and look for that black wallpaper you just downloaded from your
   Gallery.

   While this means your lockscreen might not look as cool or flashy as
   the next guy’s, you’ll enjoy a slightly longer battery life if you’re
   one of those types who are constantly checking their phone for the time
   or new notifications. You’re welcome.

13. Turn off Motions and Gestures, Air view

   [36]Galaxy S5 Motions and gestures Air view

   The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a boatload of software features. While some
   are kinda neat, we found that we didn’t actually need any of these to
   further the enjoyment of our phone. Instead, we found that turning them
   off, while unproven, should help battery life, even if only slightly. I
   mean, your Galaxy S5 watching to see if your eyes are looking at the
   display has got to eat up some battery, no matter how minimal.

   Simply jump into your Settings app, scroll down to Motions and gestures
   and turn off everything you don’t think will be very beneficial to you.
   After that, do the same with Air view and enjoy a possible slight
   increase in battery.

14. Backup photos and videos using Google+

   [37]Google Plus auto backup photos video

   Your phone already comes with Google+ pre-installed. Only thin you have
   to do is open it. During the small set up process, you’ll be asked if
   you want to back up your photos to Google+. Of course you do (probably
   only on WiFi though). And don’t worry about online drama, you don’t
   even have to use Google+ as a social network. Just set it and forget
   it. This way if you lose your phone (or move onto a new one) all of
   your photos and videos will be securely tucked away in the cloud.

   Google+ will store an unlimited amount of photos at 2048 pixels wide
   (roughly 3MP in size). If you don’t want your quality to suffer at all,
   you can always store them at full size, but that will eat into your
   Google Drive storage (about 15GB when you include Gmail). To help save
   battery life, there’s also an option to only sync when connected to a
   charger — we recommend using that option.

That’s it!

   And that should pretty cover everything you should do as a brand new
   Samsung Galaxy S5 owner. Of course, this is by no means an exhaustive
   list, but we think we covered most of the basics. Don’t forget to come
   back tomorrow for our Galaxy S5 Tips and Tricks post, detailing all the
   cool things you can do with your shiny new Galaxy S5.
