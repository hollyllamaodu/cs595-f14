       Now playing
       [45]Arthur Benjamin [46]A performance of "Mathemagic"
       In a lively show, mathemagician Arthur Benjamin races a team of
       calculators to figure out 3-digit squares, solves another massive
       mental equation and guesses a few birthdays. How does he do it?
       He’ll tell you.

       [50]Adam Spencer [51]Why I fell in love with monster prime numbers
       They're millions of digits long, and it takes an army of
       mathematicians and machines to hunt them down — what's not to love
       about monster primes? Adam Spencer, comedian and lifelong math
       geek, shares his passion for these odd numbers, and for the
       mysterious magic of math.

       Now playing
       [55]Marcus du Sautoy [56]Symmetry, reality's riddle
       The world turns on symmetry — from the spin of subatomic particles
       to the dizzying beauty of an arabesque. But there's more to it than
       meets the eye. Here, Oxford mathematician Marcus du Sautoy offers a
       glimpse of the invisible numbers that marry all symmetrical
       objects.

       [60]Clayton Cameron [61]A-rhythm-etic. The math behind the beats
       Ready to dance in your seat? Drummer Clayton Cameron breaks down
       different genres of music—from R&B to Latin to pop—by their beats.
       A talk that proves hip hop and jazz aren't cooler than math—they
       simply rely on it.

       [65]Robert Lang [66]The math and magic of origami
       Robert Lang is a pioneer of the newest kind of origami — using math
       and engineering principles to fold mind-blowingly intricate designs
       that are beautiful and, sometimes, very useful.

       Now playing
       [70]Geoffrey West [71]The surprising math of cities and
       corporations
       Physicist Geoffrey West has found that simple, mathematical laws
       govern the properties of cities — that wealth, crime rate, walking
       speed and many other aspects of a city can be deduced from a single
       number: the city's population. In this mind-bending talk from
       TEDGlobal he shows how it works and how similar laws hold for
       organisms and corporations.

       [75]Ron Eglash [76]The fractals at the heart of African designs
       'I am a mathematician, and I would like to stand on your roof.'
       That is how Ron Eglash greeted many African families he met while
       researching the fractal patterns he’d noticed in villages across
       the continent.

       [80]Benoit Mandelbrot [81]Fractals and the art of roughness
       At TED2010, mathematics legend Benoit Mandelbrot develops a theme
       he first discussed at TED in 1984 — the extreme complexity of
       roughness, and the way that fractal math can find order within
       patterns that seem unknowably complicated.

       [85]Jean-Baptiste Michel [86]The mathematics of history
       What can mathematics say about history? According to TED Fellow
       Jean-Baptiste Michel, quite a lot. From changes to language to the
       deadliness of wars, he shows how digitized history is just starting
       to reveal deep underlying patterns.

       [90]Randall Munroe [91]Comics that ask "what if?"
       Web cartoonist Randall Munroe answers simple what-if questions
       ("what if you hit a baseball moving at the speed of light?") using
       math, physics, logic and deadpan humor. In this charming talk, a
       reader’s question about Google's data warehouse leads Munroe down a
       circuitous path to a hilariously over-detailed answer — in which,
       shhh, you might actually learn something.
