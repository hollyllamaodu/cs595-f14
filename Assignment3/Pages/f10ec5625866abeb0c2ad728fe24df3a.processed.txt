An Important Step in Our Fight Against Climate Change

   Today, leaders from more than 120 countries gathered in New York. On
   the agenda: a challenge that knows no borders, produces devastating
   local impacts, and requires global action.

   President Obama joined the international community at the UN Secretary
   General's Climate Summit because he believes that we have a moral
   obligation to our children and to future generations to take decisive
   action now -- to reduce the carbon pollution and other greenhouse gas
   emissions warming the planet, and to build resilience to the climate
   impacts already being felt in communities across the country and around
   the world.

   We are the first generation to experience first-hand the chaos that
   climate scientists have long warned was coming. In recent years, we
   have been battered by more frequent and severe storms, become inundated
   by rising seas and storm surge, parched by deeper drought, and burned
   by fiercer wildfires. From the world's poorest villages to the tiniest
   seaside communities, climate change poses a real and dangerous threat.

   That's why the Obama Administration has sought to produce actionable
   climate science for the United States through the National Climate
   Assessment and has galvanized entrepreneurs and researchers to develop
   innovative climate planning tools through the Climate Data Initiative.
   And that's why, at today's UN Climate Summit, President Obama
   [343]announced that he will marshal the United States' unparalleled
   research and technological capabilities to help developing countries
   understand the scope of the climate challenge and build climate
   resilience through a set of new global public goods.

   The President committed to releasing global elevation data at a higher
   resolution than is currently freely and publicly available. Today's
   declassification and release of 30-meter elevation data for the African
   continent is a vast improvement over the previous free, open data set,
   which resolved to 90 meters. This data will enable aid organizations,
   development banks, and decision-makers in developing countries to
   better map and plan for climate-driven challenges like sea level rise
   in coastal regions and glacial melting in mountain ranges.

   Our science agencies will work to develop extreme-weather risk outlooks
   extending beyond the two-week time horizon of weather forecasts, to
   provide early indication that severe weather may be on its way and help
   save lives around the world. NOAA will seek to expand a successful
   program that has already trained more than 300 meteorologists from
   developing countries in critical aspects of climate prediction,
   monitoring, and assessment.

   And the United States is going to continue to lead by example through a
   new [344]executive order directing our international development
   agencies to factor climate resilience into their research, planning,
   and investment decisions--from malaria eradication programs to hospital
   construction to seed purchases. We're joining the new Global Alliance
   for Climate-Smart Agriculture, which seeks to preserve food security
   despite a changing climate. And the President today announced his
   intention to create a new public-private partnership to ensure climate
   data and tools are useful to, and used by, decision-makers in
   developing countries.

   But we know that without curbing the carbon pollution that is fueling
   global warming, the best data and tools we can imagine can only do so
   much to address the catastrophic impacts of climate change. Under
   President Obama's Climate Action Plan, the United States has claimed
   that mantle of leadership on this global challenge by putting America
   on the right path to achieve our 2009 Copenhagen pledge to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels
   by 2020.

   The President's plan will cut carbon pollution from existing power
   plants by 30 percent, thanks to a proposal set out by the Environmental
   Protection Agency this June. Partnerships between government and the
   private sector will deploy more clean energy, boost energy efficiency
   in more than 1 billion square feet of buildings, and phase down
   emissions of potent greenhouse gases known as HFCs -- super-pollutants
   with up to 10,000 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide
   -- by the equivalent of 700 million metric tons of CO2 by 2025.

   All told, the Obama Administration's actions since releasing the
   Climate Action Plan will cut nearly 3 billion tons of carbon pollution
   between 2020 and 2025, enable the development of more wind, solar, and
   geothermal energy, and save consumers more than $70 billion on their
   energy bills by 2030 -- all through executive action.

   Today's Summit is an important step in our fight against climate change
   -- and we're not stopping now. We're going to do more, at home and in
   international negotiations, to tackle this challenge. The United States
   remains committed to working through the UN process to forge a strong
   international framework to cut greenhouse gas emissions. And President
   Obama will continue using his pen and his phone to cut carbon
   pollution, to partner with the private sector, to deploy more clean
   energy, and to strengthen American communities threatened by climate
   impacts -- because we can't afford to wait for the climate denier
   caucus to take action.

   We're the first generation to witness the real devastation of climate
   change. We may be the last generation capable of curbing it. For the
   sake of our children, our country, and the global community, the United
   States will continue to use every tool available to us to tackle this
   challenge.

   This post is part of a month-long series produced by The Huffington
   Post in conjunction with a variety of events being held in September
   recognizing the threats posed by climate change. Those events include
   the UN's [345]Climate Summit 2014 (that was held Sept. 23, 2014, at UN
   headquarters in New York) and [346]Climate Week NYC (Sept. 22-28, 2014,
   throughout New York City). To see all the posts in the series, read
