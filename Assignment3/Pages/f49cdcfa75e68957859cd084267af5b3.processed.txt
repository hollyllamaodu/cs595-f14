   The one thing all humans have in common is that each of us wants to be
   happy, says Brother David Steindl-Rast, a monk and interfaith scholar.
   And happiness, he suggests, is born from gratitude. An inspiring lesson
   in slowing down, looking where you’re going, and above all, being
   grateful.
