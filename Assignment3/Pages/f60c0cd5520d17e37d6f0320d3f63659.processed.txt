   This session is full. Would you like to be added to the waiting list?
   By waitlisting any session you cannot schedule another session in the
   same time slot unless you remove yourself from the waiting list. If you
   are first in line on a waiting list for a session and a seat becomes
   available, then the session will be added to your schedule and you will
   receive a confirmation email. Your pre-enrollment for sessions will be
   validated onsite. We will hold your pre-enrollment until 10 minutes
   prior to the session start time, at which point your seat may be given
   to someone else if you are not present. Anyone not pre-enrolled for a
   session may be asked to wait in a stand-by line.

GlassFish Adoption Story and Deep Dive [UGF9123]

   Session Description

   Want to know who is adopting GlassFish and Java EE in real life and
   what the newest cool features in GlassFish are? If so, this session is
   definitely for you. In this session, Egypt JUG leader Mohamed Taman
   shares the story of the first-known production deployment of GlassFish
   4 and Java EE 7. He discusses how he used GlassFish and Java EE in a
   deployment for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
   (UNHCR) and the World Food Program (WFP). A GlassFish engineer then
   shares details of the latest cool GlassFish feature: the extensible
   GlassFish command-line framework. The session is hosted by a Java
   EE/GlassFish evangelist.
