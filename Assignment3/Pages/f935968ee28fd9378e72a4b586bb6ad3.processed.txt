Josh LeRibeus Ready For Possible First NFL Start

   Posted Sep 23, 2014

   [Czarda_Stephen.JPG] Stephen Czarda Associate Writer [47]@Redskins
     * [48]a
     * [49]a

With Shawn Lauvao battling a knee injury, third-year offensive lineman Josh
LeRibeus could make his first-career start vs. New York after extended action
last week.

   One season after not appearing in a single game for the Washington
   Redskins, offensive lineman [50]Josh LeRibeus [icon-article-link.gif]
   is facing the possibility of making his first-career start in a pivotal
   Week 4 matchup against the New York Giants on Thursday Night Football.

   Regardless of whether or not he’s called on to start, LeRibeus said the
   added action in practice this week with starting left guard [51]Shawn
   Lauvao [icon-article-link.gif] limited by a knee injury -- and some
   game action against in the second half of the game action the
   Philadelphia Eagles -- has helped get his mind right for a possible
   increase in workload.

   “I just take all the reps [and] watch a little extra film,” LeRibeus
   said. “I’m in there most of the time with him anyway, so I don’t want
   to play it too much differently, but getting extra reps definitely
   helps.”

   One concern for LeRibeus last season was his conditioning level, but
   after mixing in a healthier diet with an improved training regimen, the
   former third-round pick’s form is much better this season.

   It’s shown already in his three appearances this season.

   “I found myself a trainer in Dallas and just went every day and stayed
   focused,” LeRibeus said earlier this year. “I finally started to enjoy
   it just the consistency of staying in shape and being fit and ready to
   get back. I did a lot of ladder drills. They’re really fond of the
   ladder drills and foot work.

   “I (also) stayed away from the pizza and the late-night Mexican food
   and all that.”

   LeRibeus played the entire second half against the Eagles and said it
   felt “really good” to be trusted in a closely-fought game in which the
   offensive line didn’t allow a sack on quarterback [52]Kirk Cousins
   [icon-article-link.gif] .

   “I got like four plays at the end of the Jaguars game, but the last
   time I got some real action was rookie year against Seattle,” he said.
   “So it’s been a long time. ... From a physical standpoint, it was good
   just to get a few plays here and there, clean things up and get ready
   for New York.”

   Offensive coordinator Sean McVay said he's certainly noticed a change
   in LeRibeus from last season.

   "He came in in shape and has a little bit more focus," Mcvay told the
   media Tuesday. "So when he is able to go in there, he understands
   what’s going on within the game plan and it able to make the right
   adjustments in the protection or the run game accordingly."

   If needed in the starting lineup on Thursday, head coach Jay Gruden
   believes LeRibeus will be ready to go.

   "He has been ready,” Gruden said. “Josh came in, he was in great shape.
   We got Shawn in the free agency, gave him an opportunity, and it was a
   very close battle.

   “LeRibeus did a great job in training camp, kept his weight down and
   played well, so he's ready to go. I'm not concerned about Josh and his
   being ready to go.”
