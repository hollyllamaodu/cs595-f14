   Dan Barasch and James Ramsey have a crazy plan — to create a park,
   filled with greenery, underneath New York City. The two are developing
   the Lowline, an underground greenspace the size of a football field.
   They're building it in a trolley terminal abandoned in 1948, using
   technology that harvests sunlight above-ground and directs it down
   below. It's a park that can thrive, even in winter.
