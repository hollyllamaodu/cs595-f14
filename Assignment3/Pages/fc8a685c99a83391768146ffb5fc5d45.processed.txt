   Fascinated by what drives start ups to succeed, I look at the entire
   process from inception to fundraising and everything in between. I was
   previously an editor at Global Security Finance, a London-based
   newsletter covering security and defense for the finance community
   which meant uncovering start ups with exciting technologies as well as
   interviewing VCs, government officials and defense giants on their
   financing, funding and M&A strategy. As a Columbia Journalism School
   student I delved into an eclectic mix of city politics, struggling
   Harlem businesses and the interactive theatre scene. Although I’m
   British, a childhood spent in Malaysia has meant a lifelong addiction
   to Asian food. I continue to hunt down the perfect bowl of noodles in
   NYC, Sriracha sauce bottle in hand.

Bionym Inks $14M To Get Password-Replacing Wearable, Nymi Out The Door

   [44]Comment Now

   What if you didn’t have to bother typing in your password, use keys or
   even pull out a credit card ever again?

   Future-forward Canadian startup Bionym is working on it. The company
   just announced a $14 million Series A led by Ignition Partners and
   Relay Ventures who are banking on Bionym’s wearable, the Nymi catching
   on.

   The device-unlocking wristband uses an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor
   which recognizes your individual heart rhythm and automatically unlocks
   a device. Nymi’s ECG sensor doesn’t measure your actual heart rate but
   rather the electrical activity your heart generates, which is as unique
   as a finger print.

   With millions of passwords leaked in all too regular data breaches, the
   Nymi’s positioning itself as a biometric alternative. The bracelet also
   has applications in the Internet of Things as a house key,[46] Bitcoin
   wallet and others.

   Except it’s still not available yet. The company says the cash will be
   used to get the 10,000 preorders and wide release date set for sometime
   this fall.

   “We’re establishing the Nymi as the de facto platform for persistent,
   trusted identity, and this round of financing is providing us with the
   resources needed to bring the platform to market,” says CEO and founder
   Karl Martin in a press release.

   “We see the Nymi as a potential game changer,” added Nick Sturiale,
   Managing Partner of Ignition Partners. “With the breadth and depth of
   third party application developer commitments, it’s clear there is
   tangible excitement at the numerous use cases presented by extending
   identity and presence from the smart phone onto the wrist.”

   Bionym says it’s growing rapidly with almost 40 employees working out
   of a new office space in downtown Toronto. Mastercard and Salesforce
   also contributed to the round.
   Bionym's Nymi uses your heartbeat as a password.

       Biometrics would be fine for physical security but I am not certain
       for the identity authentication in cyberspace. Biometrics, whether
       static or behavioral or electromagnetic, cannot be claimed to be an
       alternative to passwords UNTIL it stops relying on a password for
       self-rescue against the false rejection altogether while retaining
       the near-zero false acceptance in the real outdoor environment.
       Biometrics operated with a password in the OR/disjunction way (as
       in the case of iPhone) offers a lower security than when only the
       password is used.
       Biometrics can theoretically be operated together with passwords in
       two ways, (1) by AND/conjunction or (2) by OR/disjunction. I would
       appreciate to hear if someone knows of a biometric product operated
       by (1). The users of such products must have been notified that,
       when falsely rejected with the devices finally locked, they would
       have to see the device reset.
       Touch ID and other biometric products are operated by (2) so that
       users can unlock the devices by passwords when falsely rejected,
       which means that the overall vulnerability of the product is the
       sum of the vulnerability of biometrics and that of a password. It
       is necessarily larger than the vulnerability of a password, say,
       the devices with Touch ID and other biometric sensors are less
       secure than the devices protected only by a password.
       As for an additional vulnerability unique to biometrics, we could
       refer to
