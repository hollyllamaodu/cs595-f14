Four Ways To Spur Shared Learning And Performance At Work

   [49]Comment Now
   [50]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Become an opportunity maker who enables others to use best talents
   together, more often, and you will become increasingly sought-after.
   Here are four proven methods to adapt to your situation.

   1. Pair Up To Cut Down Silos And To Scale Performance

   “For a week or a month, two co-workers sit next to each other at their
   computers and work on a major assignment. This happens through the
   company. Employees are paired up with different people over time.
   According [51]Sam McNerney, that’s how [52]Menlo Innovations’ CEO Rich
   Sheridan overcomes what he dubs the ‘[53]Towers of Knowledge’ problem,
   where knowledge is siloed and skills are not redundant.

   Tip: Adapt project pairing in your business, membership group or other
   organization to:

   • Facilitate cross-training in a fast, fun way.

   • Enable people in different parts of the organization to get to know
   more people in meaningful ways.

   • Enable individuals to learn how to train newcomers.

   • Prevent the organization from being hamstrung when one expert leaves.

   • [54]Cultivate collaboration, camaraderie, capacity to work through
   stress and friction, and opportunities for more ideas to bubble up as
   individuals mix it up more often via pairing.

   2. How Musical Chairs Can Foster Mutuality

   At the [55]evolving [56]Downtown [57]Project in Las Vegas, [58]Tony
   Hsieh purposefully assigns parking spaces that are at least a block
   from where employees work to spur “[59]collisions,” meaning
   serendipitous meetings between individuals. Also, some startups and
   technology firms are periodically moving employees around so they sit
   next to different people.

   musical chairs 1 Why? Well, “A worker’s immediate neighbors account for
   40% to 60% of every interaction that worker has during the workday,
   from face-to-face chats to e-mail messages. There’s only a 5% to 10%
   chance employees are interacting with someone two rows away,” according
   to [60]Ben Waber of [61]Sociometric Solutions.

   His firm [62]uses sensors to analyze [63]interaction patterns at work.
   Waber concludes, “If I keep the org chart the same but change where you
   sit, it is going to massively [64]change everything.” See [65]what
   happened at [66]Kayak, [67]Hubspot and other firms that played musical
   chairs. “Grouping workers by department can foster focus and
   efficiency,” discovered MIT’s [68]Christian Catalini, yet “[69]mixing
   them up can lead to [70]experimentation and the potential for
   breakthrough ideas.”

   “The community stagnates without the impulse of the individual. The
   impulse dies away without the sympathy of the community.” – William
   James

   3. Bungee Into Productively Engaging With Others
   It costs companies one-fifth of an employee’s annual salary to replace
   a worker who leaves, according to a 2012 study by the [71]Center for
   American Progress think tank.

   Tip: To foster retention and happy involvement in any kind of paid or
   volunteer work, arrange for people to collaborate in small groups and
   periodically switch groups and their roles within them. That way they
   can explore new sides of one another and “keep partnerships fresh like
   a healthy marriage,” [72]discovered Stanford sociologist [73]Daniel
   McFarland, who also found a second benefit: rotating leadership roles
   helps everyone involved learn new skills.

   [74]Google [75]Google encourages employees to take [76]“bungee”
   assignments for three months to one year in different areas of the
   company. That way they gain new skills and find out whether they like a
   new job (or are good at it) before committing to it. “Most staffers
   return to their original jobs with new knowledge and experiences to
   share with their workmates, ideally fostering new energy into their
   collaborations, creativity within their original groups and job
   satisfaction for themselves,” concluded McFarland.

   Also, after tracking the pattern of enduring faculty collaborations of
   newly hired, non-tenured faculty members over a 15-year period,
   McFarland found that the enduring ones happen where collaborators find
   or develop new points of [77]complement.

   “The surviving personal ties are those with a degree of similarity so
   we can communicate but a degree of difference so we can plumb the
   relationship for additional value and skills one of us may not yet
   possess,” McFarland says.

   Ongoing collaboration, mutual mentoring and other kinds of mutual
   support feel productive and satisfying. Yet periodically seek a new
   sweet spot of shared interest to keep the relationship thriving like a
   healthy marriage.

   Notice how open and proactive your partner(s) are to seeking renewed
   complements, and around what topics so you can see if they still match
   your priorities.

   4. Set The Scene For Deeper Sharing

   As McFarland said, “Cocktail parties encourage people to meet one
   another and expand their networks, but it takes retreats and
   team-building exercises to encourage trust, communication, and
   interdependence among group members. It also requires a willingness to
   rotate your expertise and roles in relationships, so that you can learn
   new sides to one another and engage in fresh experiences.”

   Also, have your organization host both internal-only and also
   by-invitation events that involve employees or members and potentially
   complementary individuals from outside the organization. Design some of
   those events for faster matchups for individuals with shared interests
   to discover each other.

   • Use a two-step “lean-then-loose” approach to an event to optimize
   attendees’ chances for making meaningful connections:

   Part One, Lean:

   In a ballroom, host a speed consulting or a speed “find the sweet spot”
   round table or a “Meet the Pros” roundtable. In the roundtables format,
   attendees sign up for seats at a table, in two rounds. For the “Sweet
   Spot” approach, a facilitator at each table guides participants in
   finding their strongest shared interest. For “Meet the Pros,”
   popularized by the National Speakers Association, each table has an
   expert who responds to questions.

   Part Two, Loose:

   Host a cocktail hour or buffet meal where participants can mix and
   mingle to have follow-up discussions with those whose interests they
   share.

   Hint: In all these methods, [78]cultivating a mutuality mindset will
   mean success.
