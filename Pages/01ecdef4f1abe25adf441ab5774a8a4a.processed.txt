Samsung Galaxy S5 hands-on and initial review

   Behold, the Samsung Galaxy S5. The Korean manufacturer at Mobile World
   Congress unveiled the fifth iteration of its flagship Android
   smartphone. And as we’ve come to expect, this one’s better than every
   one that’s come before it.
   [20]Samsung Galaxy S5 hands-on and initial review

   Let’s start with the basic Galaxy S5 specs:
     * 5.1-inch display. Android 4.4 KitKat.
     * 16-megapixel rear camera.
     * 2 gigabytes of RAM.
     * Storage options of 16 or 32 gigabytes.
     * MicroSD card storage.
     * Waterproofing with a IP67 rating.
     * 802.11 ac Wifi, with MIMIO (2x2).
     * Bluetooth 4.0 LE
     * USB 3.0.
     * NFC.
     * IR port.
     * 2,800 mAh (removable) battery.

   What else could you want in the Galaxy S5? And we haven’t even
   mentioned all the software customizations. We’ve gotten a brief look at
   the Galaxy S5 here in Barcelona. Come with us now as we walk you
   through the GS5, as only Android Central can.

Samsung Galaxy S5 hardware

     It's plenty apparent that Samsung's learning from user feedback

   Samsung continues to improve on its hardware quality, and the Galaxy S5
   shows. Moreover, it's plenty apparent that Samsung's learning from user
   feedback, and the Galaxy S5 is a reflection of that.

   The phone is just a smidgen bigger than the Galaxy S4 — the Super
   AMOLED display has been upped to 5.1 inches as well. The bezels seem a
   little larger than we'd expect, but not grossly so. The standard 1080p
   resolution is at hand here — no "2K" displays yet — and it looks great.
   That's in part because the default backgrounds and images are designed
   to show off (as well they should) and also because the Galaxy S5 has an
   improved "Adaptive Display" that will work the color gamut depending
   the lighting situation. It doesn't just get brighter or dimmer — it
   changes the way the colors look.
   [22]Samsung Galaxy S5 hands-on and initial review

   The Galaxy S5 is unmistakably a Samsung phone — right down to the home
   button. But this time around it's swapped out the legacy menu button
   for a proper multitasking key, and it's about time that happened.
   (We've previously seen this on the company's "Pro" series tablets.)

   The rear of the phone deserves some serious attention. While we'd
   figured Samsung would continue with its faux-leather (complete with
   stitching trend), it's nary to be seen on this initial crop of Galaxy
   S5. Instead, we're treated to a textured soft-touch back — not unlike
   the 2012 Nexus 7 tablet from ASUS, actually. The Galaxy S5 will
   initially be offered in charcoal black, shimmery white, electric blue
   and copper gold — and the colors themselves are pretty stunning.

     The GS5's gorgeous soft-touch back is unlike any previous Samsung
     design

                [23][s5+galaxy.jpg] [24][galaxy-s5-07_0.jpg]

   Ridged edges make up the sides of the phone. The volume and power
   buttons are in their usual places. The Galaxy S5 most certainly looks
   and feels like a Samsung product, as it should. But it's probably the
   best Samsung's come up with so far.

   If we had to pick one thing to gripe about, it'd be the camera stack
   out back. It's not a huge bulge, but it's noticeable. There's also some
   additional bulk that has to come with the inclusion of waterproofing,
   and the plastic flap covering the charging port may become an annoyance
   for some. But that's us looking for nits to pick. The GS5's hardware
   looks and feels solid, more so than any Galaxy S phone for the past
   couple of years.
   [25][galaxy-s5-hero.jpg]

Samsung Galaxy S5 software

   The industrial design is but the first way Samsung has improved things
   in the Galaxy S5. Software's the next. The Galaxy S5 is running Android
   4.4.2 KitKat out of the box, and it's paired quite nicely with
   Samsung's custom user interface.

   You read that right. Five years into the Galaxy S line, TouchWiz has
   come around. Maybe some of that is Google's doing — the white status
   bar fits right in. Launcher and menu icons have taken a turn for the
   flat.
   [26][galaxy-s5-home.jpg]

     This no longer is the clown-colored user interface we've for so long
     tried to hide.

   Truly, this no longer is the clown-colored user interface we've for so
   long tried to hide.

   That's not to say there's not a lot going on — because there is.
   Samsung has still crammed so many features into this phone. The quick
   settings, for instance, had 20 buttons when we took a look. There's a
   veritable armada of Samsung apps. (And plenty more you can download on
   your own.) And on the whole, they're a little sharper and less visually
   cluttered than earlier TouchWiz efforts, even if everything remains
   bright and vivid on the phone's SuperAMOLED panel.

           [27][galaxy-s5-14_0.jpg] [28][galaxy-s5-private-1.jpg]

   And the ever-clever Samsung has put its Magazine UI where Google Now
   lives on the Nexus 5 — at the far left of the homescreen.

   For enhanced security, the Galaxy S5 also supports biometric
   authentication through its finger scanner — up to three fingers can be
   stored, swipe you finger down from just above the home button to unlock
   the device or perform other security-related functions. One such
   feature shown to us used PayPal — the company has partnered with
   Samsung to use the GS5's biometric capabilities — to confirm a purchase
   with the user's fingerprint.

   Another feature we're liking is Private Mode, which lets you keep
   pictures, music, documents, video and voice files behind a secondary
   password and away from prying eyes.

   So, yeah. There's a whole lot going on in the Galaxy S5, but it's
   nicely done, and a bit more professional-looking than before.

              [29][galaxy-s5-22_0.jpg] [30][galaxy-s5-27_0.jpg]

Samsung Galaxy S5 camera

     HDR mode now gives you a live preview of your HDR shot.

   The Galaxy S5 packs a 16-megapixel rear camera with dual LED flash and
   a slew of shooting modes, but Samsung is focusing on a handful of new
   features. Selective focus lets you adjust depth of field after you've
   taken your shot — we've seen similar stuff from Sony and Nokia in
   recent months. And HDR mode now gives you a live preview of how your
   high-dynamic-range image is going to look. Samsung's also touting the
   speed of the GS5's autofocus as a key camera feature, saying it can
   focus in as little as 0.3 seconds depending on lighting — and
   side-by-side with the GS4, the difference in focus speed is pretty
   striking.
   [31][galaxy-s5-colors-1_0.jpg]

     The GS5's flash doubles as a heart rate sensor.

   As for image quality, we'll have to reserve judgment until we've spend
   some more time with the device, but photos shot in our relatively small
   demo area looked great on the Galaxy S5's screen, and capture speeds
   were about as fast as any smartphone we've used.

   In addition, there's an interesting secondary function for the GS5's
   camera flash — it doubles as a heart rate sensor when used with the S
   Health app. Hold you finger over the flash and it'll glow red, allowing
   the phone to monitor your heart rate. And of course you can track all
   this stuff over time through S Health, which, as on the GS4, is
   designed to be your health and fitness hub on your phone.
   [32][galaxy-s5-s4-1.jpg]

The bottom line

   Our main takeaway from our brief time with the Galaxy S5 so far is that
   Samsung is has been listening to customers and critics alike, and has
   finally gotten around to addressing many of our gripes with its build
   quality, software and UI. It's still a plastic phone, and a plastic
   phone running TouchWiz at that, but the GS5 represents a clear
   improvement for Samsung in a bunch of important areas. The new Samsung
   UI strikes us as something we might enjoy using, rather than software
   that's just there. And the soft-touch back feels infinitely nicer in
   the hand than the glossy, slimy plastic of old.

   The most interesting development out of the GS5's announcement might be
   the arrival of waterproofing as a mainstream feature. Other Android
   manufacturers, notably Sony, have been doing this for a while, but a
   waterproof GS5 is a big commitment on Samsung's part

   We'll be seeing a lot more of the Samsung Galaxy S5 in the months
   ahead, and our opinions are sure to evolve as we spend more time with
   the phone. For the moment, though, it's a promising start to 2014 for
   the world's biggest maker of Android phones.
