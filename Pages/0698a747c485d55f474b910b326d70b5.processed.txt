Mexican Broadcaster Televisa Fires Reporter Who Coached And Accepted Money
From A Mexican Organized Crime Figure

   [44]Comment Now
   [45]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   While it has long been believed that some Mexican journalists,
   particularly in Mexico’s crime-ridden regions, are bribed by drug
   cartels, a new video emerged in Mexico showing two reporters accepting
   money from kingpin Servando Gómez Martínez, leader of the Knights
   Templar.

   Eliseo Caballero, Televisa correspondent in Michoacán, and José Luis
   Díaz, owner of Esquema news agency, are seen accepting bill after bill
   directly from Gómez. Caballero is heard asking Gómez for money to buy
   cameras and Díaz to buy a truck in the 24-minute video, which was first
   [46]broadcast on Monday on MVS Radio’s morning news show hosted by
   Carmen Aristegui.

   Better known as “La Tuta,” Gómez is the leader of a savage criminal
   organization that has turned the Western state of Michoacán into one of
   Mexico’s most violent and ungovernable.

   MVS Radio, which I report for from [47]Washington, D.C., uploaded
   a still image taken from the video to its website. The video was
   provided by an anonymous source.

   Shortly after the video was aired, Televisa released a statement saying
   that the media giant was unaware of Caballero’s dealing with La Tuta.
   After announcing that Caballero had been fired, Televisa said that it
   had filed a complaint with Mexican law enforcement about the reporter’s
   links to La Tuta, one of Mexico’s most-wanted criminals.

   On its evening news, Televisa said the company has no institutional
   relations with criminal groups and that its editorial policy prohibits
   broadcasting propaganda,  whether in print, videos or banners, issued
   by Mexican drug organizations.

   Grupo Televisa, which captures nearly 70% of Mexico’s broadcast
   television audience, is owned by Mexican media mogul [48]Emilio
   Azcarraga Jean. Azcarraga is currently worth an estimated  $3.1
   billion, according to Forbes. He ranked number 554 on Forbes 2014
   World’s Billionaires list.

   In the video, Caballero and Díaz give media advice to La Tuta on how to
   better get the Knights Templar’s message across. Caballero tells the
   drug lord: “As I once told you, [you should issue] at least one banner
   [daily.] For us, banners [i.e. printed messages] are a source of
   information.”

   MVS interviewed the two reporteres separately by phone. Both confirmed
   they met with La Tuta but insisted they were forced to do so by
   the Knights Templar.

   Caballero said on Twitter that at the time of the meeting he realized
   that his life and that of his family was in danger if he refused to see
   La Tuta or contradicted what the drug lord did and said. In a separate
   statement, Díaz said that in the past, organized crime groups had
   kidnapped and tortured him.

   Sergio Aguayo, a Mexican academician and human rights activist, said
   the two reporters are directly responsible, since they “showed
   willingness to help La Tuta repair his image.”

   In 2009, the Southern Distric of New York[49] indicted La Tuta for
   conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine and methamphetamines to the
   United States from Mexico. In 2010, the Treasury Department sanctioned
   La Tuta under the ”Kingpin Act” for his involvement in drug
   trafficking.
