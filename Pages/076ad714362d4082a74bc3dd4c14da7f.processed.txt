Lockdown: How Haven Hopes To Protect Your Home And Bury The Deadbolt Forever

   [48]Comment Now
   [49]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Thanks to crowdfunding, the notion of unlocking your door with a
   smartphone instead of a key has become a reality. From [50]Lockitron to
   [51]August, a number of projects haven got off the ground thanks to
   early adopters pre-ordering the product more than a year in advance.
   But Haven, a Nashville startup is taking a different approach. It wants
   to stay firmly planted on the ground, securing your door with a near
   magical “riser” that lifts up from the floor to prevent someone from
   entering your home. Like the others, it’s hoping to gain market
   validation and capital through crowdfunding, launching on Kickstarter
   today.

   The way Clay Banks, Haven’s founder, tells the story, he got the idea
   early this year when a series of break-ins occurred in the town of
   Franklin, a Nashville suburb where he lives. The thief had gained
   access via a technique called “[52]lock bumping” and Banks felt there
   had to be a better way to protect homes. More recently, Banks says, he
   became further concerned by a new app which allows someone to
   [53]duplicate a key merely by capturing a clear photo of it.

   “We’ve lived under this false sense of security,” he says, explaining
   the need for something better. The product he and partner Alex Bertelli
   hope to create, the Haven smart lock, is comprised of “mechanical lift
   gate barriers that rise up from the ground.” The easiest way to
   understand it is to see it (as in the image above and the [54]video
   here, which gets especially entertaining around the 1:15 mark).

   Banks and Bertelli are planning to build a device that works seamlessly
   with the so-called internet of things. To that end, while the Haven
   will of course be able to be operated with a smartphone, they hope to
   eventually allow it to be paired with any Bluetooth devices you approve
   to act as “keys.” In that way, you could go running with a fitness
   tracker and use that to lock and unlock your home simply. Like the
   Lockitron, the Haven will make use of WiFi and Bluetooth to be both
   connected to the internet but also locally operated with low power.

   One advantage the Haven has over deadbolt solutions is size. Though
   it’s designed to be unobtrusive at .8 inches in height and 3 inches in
   width, the Haven is 30 inches long — to run most of the length of the
   typical door. This gives it a lot of strength to keep an intruder out
   and a lot of space inside for a battery. Bertelli says the battery will
   be rechargeable, though exactly how hasn’t been determined yet. But the
   company is targeting 6 months of battery life. Convincing people to
   maintain their door lock even twice a year is just one of several
   challenges Haven will face if they are to move home security from the
   door to the floor.

   The other is installation. Banks is planning a series of install
   videos, like those provided by Nest to help with its eponymous
   thermostat, but he acknowledges that bolting the Haven into the floor
   is a different challenge. Depending on whether you have a crawl space
   or concrete slab, whether you have tile or wood, you’ll need different
   drill bits and different amounts of care to get the installation just
   right. The folks at Lockitron and August have learned that working with
   existing deadbolts provides one set of challenges, but in those cases,
   typically an install gone wrong doesn’t make a mess of the door.

   With Haven, some homes will likely prove tricky. Occasionally someone
   might crack a marble tile or screw into the edge of a floor joist.
   Banks does note that you don’t have to attach it to a joist however. As
   long as the product goes through the subfloor, any attempted break-in
   should be thwarted. “The force is directed straight down,” he says. “We
   had a 260 lb. guy with a special forces background try to kick it, ram
   it, sledgehammer it.” If you watch the video linked above, you’ll see
   he wasn’t successful in breaking through.


   Aside from making the hardware robust, the Haven guys are already
   thinking about the software. They plan to make it possible to issue
   “keys” that only work in specified time windows. That way you can let
   your house cleaners in every Wednesday between noon and 3, for example,
   but not the rest of the week. There will also be single-day keys and
   alerts to confirm arrival. Parents can then know their kids are home
   safely and the door is locked behind them. Haven plans on supporting
   integration with Apple’s HomeKit and Google’s Nest developer program.

   The Haven team already has 12 people, encompassing design, software
   engineering and supply-chain management. Though the company is based in
   Tennessee, in many ways it resembles a Silicon Valley affair, with
   everyone working mostly for a piece of the company at this point. Banks
   and Bertelli have contributed some of their own resources to get things
   off the ground but hope to raise $150,000 from the Kickstarter to fund
   final designs and tooling. They are aware that the other smart-lock
   projects have had a tendency to slip from their original schedules —
   often by a great margin. The duo plan on delivering their first
   products to backers next August. While that seems far away, if they hit
   the date, it will be among the shortest gaps between order-taking and
   delivery of any smart lock to date.

   Haven is asking backers to think about home protection in a new way,
   which could intimidate some. But with a price target starting around
   $200 for early backers, it’s consistent with other offerings in the
   segment. The Lockitron runs $179 and the August is available for $249.
   Whether Haven can match the crowdfunding success of the others remains
   to be seen. Lockitron received more than 14,000 orders and $2 million
   before shipping a single unit to customers. August, which has raised
   $10 million in total, sold thousands of locks last October and only
   just recently began shipping.

   (By way of disclosure, I backed both projects. The Lockitron arrived
   long after I’d assumed it never would and for a number of reasons, I’ve
   not installed it. While August is said to be shipping, they’ve not
   notified me and I backed the project with a pre-order the first day).
   Neither of those companies used Kickstarter, though another project
   called [55]Goji did gather funding via Indiegogo. Haven is asking
   backers to trust that it will not only deliver, but also that its
   innovative approach is one to trust. Banks believes “Kickstarter is a
   perfect platform for an internet of things devices… it’s perfect to
   validate the concept and design.” It’s now up to the market to decide
   if he’s right.
