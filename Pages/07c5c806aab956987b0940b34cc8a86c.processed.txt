   I am an experienced freelance technology journalist. I write for Wired,
   The Next Web, TrustedReviews and the BBC in addition to Forbes.
   I began in b2b print journalism covering tech companies at the height
   of the dot com boom and switched to covering consumer technology as the
   iPod began to take off.
   A career highlight for me was being a founding member of
   TrustedReviews. It started in 2003 and we were repeatedly told websites
   could not compete with print! Within four years we were purchased by
   IPC Media (Time Warner's publishing division) to become its flagship
   tech title.
   What fascinates me are the machinations of technology's biggest
   companies. Got a pitch, tip or leak? Contact me on [41]Twitter ,

iOS 8 Hit By WiFi And Battery Life Complaints

   [50]Comment Now
   [51]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Having [52]reviewed the iPhone 6 and found iOS 8 to be a fast, fluid
   and error free experience it now seems many owners of older iPhones and
   iPads have not been so lucky.


   Bloggers [53]Tech 2 spotted this fast growing [54]Apple Support
   Communities thread citing ‘iOS 8 WiFi Problems’ with comments from
   iPhone 5S, iPad Air and iPad mini owners. The thread has also expanded
   to complaints about iOS 8 battery life problems, the performance of
   apps and even the loss of cell phone data.

   Notably user ‘Morac’ states:


   “Chatted with [55]Apple [56]Apple support and they had me do a restore
   and set up as new. I did that since I’m seeing other glitches in iOS 8.
   It seemed to work after that, but I only tested for a few minutes and
   didn’t do the ping test (which I should have done as that would have
   given me a definitive answer). I then restored my backup and the issues
   returned. Apple support implied if restoring as new didn’t fix the
   problem, then it’s a hardware problem. Considering the number of
   reports about this, he can’t be correct.”


   So far Apple has not issued any formal response and no Apple staff have
   replied to the Support Communities thread which was started on
   September 20.

   Comment

   Reports of this nature are not unusual with iOS updates. Apple’s
   control over hardware and software is typically cited as a major
   advantage for its fast and reliable iOS roll-outs, but there are still
   millions of variables such as app combinations and settings which can
   play havoc.


   As it stands I would play down Tech 2’s description that the software
   update “plagues users”. iOS 8 updates will run into the 100s of
   millions and one Communities Support thread – despite appearing popular
   – is not confirmation of a much wider problem.


   That said these aren’t the first problems we’ve seen with iOS 8.
   Notably iPhone 4S owners have [58]complained about greatly reduced
   performance and on a scale which suggests Apple will need to release a
   software patch to address it in the near future.


   It is also widely reported that iOS 8 adoption has been [59]slower than
   that of iOS 7 (possibly due to iPhone 4S owners holding fire), but we
   will get a more accurate picture after greater time has passed.


   If you have had problems with your iOS 8 update – either along the same
   lines as the Support Community thread or otherwise – let us know.


   And for those who have upgraded to iOS 8 without a problem you can read
   about Amadou’s exploration of its [60]best new features, Mark’s take on
   [61]where it missed the mark and my guide to the [62]best third party
   keyboards.
   Update: Apple did not respond to requests to comment, but has released
   iOS 8.0.2. Unfortunately that now appears to be [63]suffering from
   Bluetooth connectivity problems.

       The biggest issue that has impacted me is the Safari bug that
       prevents file uploads on mobile web sites. The main impact for most
       users is that they upload photos to WordPress or Facebook when
       using the mobile web, but it has also impacted internal web
       applications that I am maintaining at my company.

       Your headline is still: “iOS 8 Hit By WiFi And Battery Life
       Problems”, with no qualifiers despite the fact you write: “As it

       You’re actually right. Irony being that since the post went live
       I’ve had many comments both on this article and to me on Twitter
       reiterating these problems. So now it is a problem, but I’ll made
       an edit.

       Apple Support told me the same “millions of people are not having
       this problem” and “you can find confirmation of any diagnosis of
       any problem you make up on the internet” as ways of subtly blaming
       its customers for this bug.

       I’ve noticed a slow down in my Wifi speed on my 5S since upgrading.
       I wasn’t sure of the issue, but when I turn off Wifi and use Data
       only, Safari runs considerably quicker. The issue seems to be
       intermittent.
       Also running into issue of apps, including iMessage, randomly
       closing during operation. No particular app seems to be the issue,
       it is random, but never happened prior to upgrade.
       Have not contacted Apple support, as the issue is very new, but
       will follow up now.

       I had problems with the iPad 2 losing WiFi. I have had no problems

       On an Apple Forum thread – Ipad mini with retina wifi extremely
       slow/dead after ios 8 update – several people discuss this same
       problem. They have come to discover that many of them had dual band
       routers and that their apple device, after the ios 8 update, wifi
       became extremely slow if it worked at all even though it showed it
       was connected. They found that the solution was to switch from 5
       Ghz on the router to 2.4 Ghz – after doing so, the devices worked
       just fine, including my iPad Air after I switched to 2.4 Ghz. The
       trouble is, I want to connect at 5 Ghz. My other Apple devices
       (iPad 2 and iPhone 5) that I have not yet updated have been and
       still are doing just fine at 5 Ghz. Obviously, then, this is a bug
       in IOS 8 and not a hardware problem. I can only hope that Apple
       will realize and accept this FACT and fix the bug.

       This has and will happen every year. Best thing to do is only
       upgrade to the next iOS once or not at all.

       Interesting idea. I never considered just being happy with the iOS
       that was designed for my device. That is a very valid solution.
       Apple said it was compatible and I thought it would be.

       I’ve also noticed a slow down in Wifi on my Ipad Air. Overall, just
       seems to be running slower since the upgrade. I’m disappointed and
       hope Apple will fix these bugs.
