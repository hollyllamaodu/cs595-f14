   Greenhouse gases reached historic highs in 2013, a U.N. report says, in
   part because of rising emissions from automobiles and smokestacks.

   By [34]Joby Warrick September 9 [35]Follow @jobywarrick

   Levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose at a
   record-shattering pace last year, [36]a new report shows, a surge that
   surprised scientists and spurred fears of an accelerated warming of the
   planet in decades to come.

   Concentrations of nearly all the major greenhouse gases reached
   historic highs in 2013, reflecting ever-rising emissions from
   automobiles and smokestacks but also, scientists believe, a diminishing
   ability of the world’s oceans and plant life to soak up the excess
   carbon put into the atmosphere by humans, according to data released
   early Tuesday by the United Nations’ meteorological advisory body.

   The latest figures from the [37]World Meteorological Organization’s
   monitoring network are considered particularly significant because they
   reflect not only the amount of carbon pumped into the air by humans,
   but also the complex interaction between man-made gases and the natural
   world. Historically, about half of the pollution from human sources has
   been absorbed by the oceans and by terrestrial plants, preventing
   temperatures from rising as quickly as they otherwise would, scientists
   say.

   “If the oceans and the biosphere cannot absorb as much carbon, the
   effect on the atmosphere could be much worse,” said Oksana Tarasova, a
   scientist and chief of the WMO’s[38] Global Atmospheric Watch program,
   which collects data from 125 monitoring stations worldwide. The
   monitoring network is regarded as the most reliable window on the
   health of Earth’s atmosphere, drawing on air samples collected near the
   poles, over the oceans, and in other locations far from cities and
   other major sources of pollution.

   The new figures for carbon dioxide were particularly surprising,
   showing the biggest year-over-year increase since detailed records were
   first compiled in the 1980s, Tarasova said in an interview. The jump of
   nearly three parts per million over 2012 levels was twice as large as
   the average increase in carbon levels in recent decades, she said.

   “The changes we’re seeing are really drastic,” Tarasova said. “We are
   seeing the growth rate rising exponentially.”

   The organization’s annual report on greenhouse gas levels was released
   ahead of a [41]climate summit of world leaders at this year’s U.N.
   General Assembly meetings in New York. On Sept. 23, President Obama
   will meet with chief executives from dozens of other countries to
   discuss ways to lower industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, methane
   and other gases blamed for heating up the planet.

   Natural carbon dioxide is an essential ingredient for life on Earth,
   enabling green plants to convert sunlight into energy. But at excessive
   levels it acts as a heat trap, causing the planet to warm. Scientists
   say that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been
   rising since the start of the Industrial Revolution and that the
   increase has accelerated since the 1990s.

   The WMO’s data for 2013 shows the global average level of atmospheric
   carbon at just under 400 parts per million, about 40 percent higher
   than in pre-industrial times and higher than in any other period in at
   least 800,000 years. The symbolically important threshold of 400 parts
   per million — described by scientists as the level at which more
   dramatic climactic impacts become likely — will probably be crossed in
   the next two years, the report said.

   “It’s the level that climate scientists have identified as the
   beginning of the danger zone,” said[42] Michael Oppenheimer, a
   Princeton University professor of geosciences who was not involved in
   the WMO report. “It means we’re probably getting to the point where
   we’re looking at the ‘safe zone’ in the rearview mirror, even as we’re
   stepping on the gas.”

   A [43]landmark report last year by a U.N.-appointed panel of climate
   scientists warned that, if current trends continue, the world could
   soon see major disruptions to both natural ecosystems and human
   civilization, including rising sea levels that could swamp many of the
   world’s coastal cities. That report, by the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change, projected a rise in temperatures of up to nine degrees
   in the next century unless action is taken to lower carbon dioxide
   levels in the atmosphere.

   Methane, another major greenhouse gas, also rose significantly in the
   WMO’s latest report, continuing a steady climb that began six years
   ago. Global concentrations of methane — a byproduct of farming and
   fossil-fuel extraction, as well as numerous natural processes — are now
   2^1 / [2 ]times as high as they were at the start of the industrial
   age, in the mid-18th century, the report said.

   The organization’s annual report included, for the first time, figures
   on the increasing acidification of the oceans stemming from higher
   levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As the seas absorb more
   carbon dioxide from the air, the water’s chemical composition becomes
   more acidic. Studies extrapolating from the fossil record suggest that
   the rate of acidification is now “unprecedented, at least over the past
   300,000 years,” the WMO said.

   Higher acidity in seawater is known to disrupt the life cycles of many
   marine species — from reef-building corals to shellfish beloved by
   humans — by interfering with the creatures’ ability to use sea-borne
   calcium to build their shells.

   In an indirect way, the acidification of seawater also exacerbates
   climate change: The oceans over time become less capable of absorbing
   carbon from the air, allowing more of the greenhouse gas to accumulate
   in the atmosphere, the report said.
