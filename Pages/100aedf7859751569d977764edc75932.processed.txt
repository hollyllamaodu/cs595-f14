Bitcoin Bruiser: Feds Shut Down Butterfly Labs As PayPal Realizes It
Shouldn't Work With Companies Like That

   [51]Comment Now
   [52]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments
   Bitcoin mining equipment maker Butterfly Labs is closed for business,
   after the FTC asked a federal court for a temporary restraining order

   There have long been online complaints about Butterfly Labs, a
   Missouri-based maker of Bitcoin mining equipment that started
   operations in 2010. People complained in Bitcoin forums that the
   company charged them in advance for high-speed encryption machines that
   arrived months late, damaged, or not at all. Some angry customers sued,
   as documented by [53]Ars Technica in an article that contained
   disturbing information about Butterfly Labs’ cocoon. In the same year
   it was founded, one of the founders, Sonny Vleisides, pled guilty to
   mail fraud for his “involvement in an international, multi-million
   dollar lottery scam.” So he was perhaps not the guy you want to send
   money to because he promises he’ll send you a money-making machine in
   return. After getting hundreds of complaints about the company, the
   Federal Trade Commission investigated and announced Tuesday that it got
   a temporary restraining order from [54]a federal court to shut the
   company down and freeze its assets. The FTC alleges that Butterfly Labs
   collected between $20 million and $50 million from customers, charging
   thousands of dollars for computing equipment that either never arrived
   or was useless by the time it did. Meanwhile, according to FTC attorney
   Helen Wong, the company’s owners were using company credit cards for
   personal shopping outings at Nordstroms and Bed, Bath & Beyond; to get
   massages; go to saunas; and to buy guns. That last one could only be a
   business expense if the owners were preparing for customers descending
   on them with pitchforks.

   In response, Butterfly Labs claims that its business is “[55]very
   real,” that it has shipped $33 million worth of equipment to customers
   and refunded $17 million worth, and that it looks forward to defending
   itself in court. The FTC claims Butterfly Labs put “Bitforce” mining
   machines up for sale on its website in June 2012 for $149 – nearly
   $30,000 each, promising an October 2012 delivery date. They should have
   been called Bitfarce machines. Over 20,000 customers ordered them but
   none had received them over a year later, according to the FTC
   complaint. In November 2013, Butterfly Labs claimed all the Bitforce
   machines had shipped but “consumers continued to file complaints about
   not receiving their prepaid BitForce mining machine,” says the FTC. In
   August 2013, Butterfly offered up the Monarch machine and asked people
   to pay thousands for it upfront, promising delivery by April. “As of
   August 2014, Defendants had yet to ship a single Monarch machine,” says
   the FTC.
   [56]The Forbes eBook On Bitcoin
   [57]Secret Money: Living on Bitcoin in the Real World, by Forbes staff
   writer Kashmir Hill, can be bought in Bitcoin or more traditional
   currencies.

   In many cases, the customers had paid for the machines with real money.
   “For all orders, [Butterfly Labs] required consumers to pay up-front by
   PayPal, Bitcoins, or bank wire transfer the entire amount of an order
   at the time the order is placed,” says the complaint.

   Moving forward, PayPal, for one, is going to make it harder for Bitcoin
   enthusiasts to be fleeced. The same day the FTC announced its crackdown
   on Butterfly Labs, PayPal [58]announced plans to partner with Bitcoin
   payment processors Coinbase, Bitpay and GoCoin so that merchants using
   PayPal can start accepting Bitcoin… but only for digital goods such as
   ringtones and games. In [59]its blog post about it, PayPal’s senior
   director of corporate strategy Scott Ellison offhandedly mentioned news
   directly relevant to the Butterfly Labs crackdown:

     For some time now, we’ve helped merchants selling Bitcoin mining
     equipment to accept PayPal payments. This will continue. But to
     safeguard customers, we’ve decided not to work with merchants who
     pre-sell these products.

   Good decision! As first reported by [60]Ars Technica, PayPal allegedly
   smelled something afoul at Butterfly Labs a while ago. According to the
   probation officer for the Butterfly Labs founder with the mail fraud
   conviction, “Chad Williams, a PayPal global asset protection officer,
   told her that as of September 2013, PayPal froze Butterfly Labs’
   account containing $11 million and that PayPal received 6,000
   complaints in total.” According to the officer, PayPal had banned
   Butterfly Labs from its platform by December 2013.

   Via the PayPal post:

     This is consistent with our approach to pre-sales of other goods; we
     hold off anytime we determine that pre-selling may not provide a
     good buyer experience. Pre-selling is when a business asks for money
     up-front for a product or service it will deliver in the future.
     Customers may not get their money back if the business goes out of
     business before the product is shipped but after a buyer protection
     period expires. Again, our decision not to support pre-sales is
     shaped by our desire to protect our customers.

   If you try to order a product from Butterfly Labs now, the only payment
   option is Bitcoin, but an error message pops up if you try to place an
   order.

       ” it has shipped $33 million worth of equipment to customers and
       refunded $17 million worth”
       That ratio should not be a “ defense” and really speaks volumes.
       Is there anyone in the mining rig business who has been trustworthy
       over a long period of time Kashmir?

       Try Xidax. They are a bit on the moderate price range, but as is
       specified on their site – there is a guarantee.
       The entry level Xidax will pay for itself within months. The better
       the processor, the faster it will pay for itself

       Many people involved with Bitcoin, including the Bitcoin Foundation
       and the BitcoinTalk.org forum, knew about this for a long time yet
       the ads still ran and nothing was done by the Foundation pursuant
       to their stated mission.
