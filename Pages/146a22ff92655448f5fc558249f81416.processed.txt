Hello World! What Every CS Student Should Know About the First Job

   by [65]Dave Fecak on October 14th, 2013 | Filed in: [66]Career

   Anyone involved with hiring entry-level technology professionals (or
   reads posts on Reddit’s [67]cscareerquestions forum) is aware that
   students are being prepared by schools for how to do work in the
   industry, but are often ill-prepared on how to find work in the
   industry.  There is a major difference between the two, and many grads
   are being edged out on jobs by equally or even less-qualified peers who
   were just a bit more proactive about their career. If you think finding
   a job is only about internships and GPAs, please keep reading.

   Some students feel that if they aren’t working 10 hours a day building
   the next Twitter from their dorm room, or if they didn’t intern at
   Google or Amazon, that they will struggle to find work.  This is hardly
   the case, and I assure you that if you do a few things during your
   college years (that require a minimal time investment and no money),
   you will be several steps ahead when it is time to apply for your first
   job.

   Everyone knows about finding internships, good grades, and putting
   together a solid résumé.  But there’s more to it than that for today’s
   grads.  Here are some things that college freshmen (or even high school
   students) that intend to pursue a career in technology can do to give
   themselves a head start on the competition.

   [68]imgres

   I tend to find that college students and even early career candidates
   often have Facebook, Google +, and Twitter accounts, but no LinkedIn
   profile.  But I thought LinkedIn was a place to signup only when I was
   about to start looking for a job?  Nope.  LinkedIn is your [69][DEL:
   Rolodex :DEL]  (forgot my audience) address book of professional
   contacts, and there are plenty of reasons to start building that
   database and network even before you are a full professional.

   Did you intern with a company last summer?  Connect to your co-workers
   on LinkedIn. Did you interview for an internship, but didn’t get the
   job?  Connect with your interviewers on LinkedIn.  Did some industry
   professionals come to campus and speak to your class?  Connect with
   them on LinkedIn.  Did a recent grad or classmate start a business?
   Got a favorite professor?  Connect!

   Beyond just the ability to connect like you do on Facebook or Google +,
   LinkedIn also has thousands of virtual networking groups that include a
   wide range of specific and general topics.  Many of these groups are
   related directly to employment, and most of them are monitored (and
   sometimes infested) by recruiters that could be valuable connections to
   make before graduation.

   Once your profile is completed with your experience and any relevant
   technical buzzwords to attract recruiters or hiring professionals, you
   may expect to receive connection invites and blurbs on job
   opportunities.  Having more connections means that you will appear in
   more searches, but most in the industry still use some discretion in
   connecting.

   I don’t want to overstate the importance of LinkedIn as I think too
   much is often made of the site by so-called “social media experts”, and
   endorsements have become a running joke, but industry pros that you
   don’t know well are more likely to accept a LinkedIn connection than a
   friend request on Facebook. Graduating college with anywhere from 50 to
   500 LinkedIn connections gives you a place to start your job search
   that is infinitely more productive that applications to random jobs on
   Monster or Craigslist.

   I write about GitHub so much that even I’m sick of watching myself
   write about GitHub (where’s my t-shirt?!). If LinkedIn is your
   professional address book, GitHub is a combination of your sketch pad,
   notebook, and even a [71][DEL: Trapper Keeper :DEL]  folder (did it
   again) to file past assignments.  There are other code repo sites out
   there, but GitHub is the leader today.

   What’s so great about GitHub?  First, by using it you’ll learn how to
   use the Git tool itself and how version control works to some degree,
   which has value in itself (and another Skills entry for your résumé).
   You can also take advantage of [72]GitHub Pages, which gives you free
   hosting and customizable themes for a web page that you can have up in
   minutes. More importantly, your GitHub account is perhaps one of the
   best ways to demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

   If you are going to be writing some bits of code for various school
   projects, even if they are small and generic exercises like FizzBuzz or
   Conway’s Game of LIfe, why not retain those as potential work samples
   at GitHub?  As your skills improve, you can go back and refactor and
   optimize your code so that it is representative of your current ability
   level.

   Once you develop some comfort level with your coding skills, you can
   explore some other public repos and start contributing to open source
   projects or even start your own.  You don’t need to have some
   substantial GitHub account upon graduation in order to get a job, but
   there is no reason not to keep your code all in a safe place for others
   to view down the line.  A GitHub account has quickly become a common
   request from many employers in the industry, so having these samples
   available can make a significant difference.

   [73]so-logo

   Stack Overflow is a question and answer site used by a large percentage
   of the programming world to help themselves and others.  It has a
   massive collection of past threads that is like a FAQ for the tech
   world, as well as many unique threads that would be considered Rarely
   Asked Questions.  The site’s gamification model allows participants to
   earn reputation points for highly rated questions and answers, and
   those points can serve as yet another potential indicator of your
   knowledge as an entry-level candidate.

   Can I really get a job based on some arbitrary internet points I earned
   through asking or answering questions?  Of course not.  But again, it
   serves as an indicator of your interest in the profession, the time you
   invest in your craft, and your willingness to both seek and provide
   answers with others in the industry.

   I wouldn’t suggest spending hundreds of hours on the site in order to
   accrue a massive point total, but checking out the questions being
   asked and chiming in when appropriate has value.  The questions and
   trends will also give you a finger on the pulse of the industry, and
   perhaps ideas as to which languages or technologies may be lacking a
   pulse.

   [74]logo

   Users’ groups and Meetups are another way to demonstrate your interest
   while learning. You attend class because you have to (or are supposed
   to anyway), but you attend Meetups because you want to.  I have managed
   a users’ group for almost 14 years that met on a college campus for
   several years, and many of the student attendees now have highly
   successful careers.  In addition to the ability to hear informative
   presentations and group discussions, Meetups are perhaps the most
   useful way for students to meet industry pros that may be incredible
   resources during your first job search.  (If you haven’t figured this
   out on your own, connect with your fellow Meetup members on LinkedIn.)

   If you can’t get to group meetings due to location, there may even be
   some users’ groups and Meetups that happen right on your college
   campus.  None at your school, eh?  That’s too bad.  If only there were
   a group on campus…  Congratulations, you are now the founder (and
   chapter president, of course) of the Springfield University Python
   Meetup!

Conclusion

   Creating a profile in any of these sites takes minutes and has no cost.
    With LinkedIn you can start making connections in seconds, and logging
   in even once a month to accept and send connection requests is pretty
   standard.  Using GitHub for your coding assignments or projects will
   become second nature, and exploring other repos can be done as time
   permits.  Stack Overflow is something you can visit once a week or as
   necessary, and over time you will build reputation while learning.  A
   user group or meetup is typically a monthly meeting.  All this adds up
   to just a couple extra hours a month, which is a small investment for
   the rewards it can provide.
