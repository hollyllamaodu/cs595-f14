   The struggle of mental health
   Depression, schizophrenia, suicidal feelings—too often, these
   experiences stay private. These speakers who’ve struggled with mental
   illness boldly share their stories, in hopes that others don’t feel so
   alone.

Playlist (7 talks): The struggle of mental health

     * [44]29:21
       Now playing
       [45]Andrew Solomon [46]Depression, the secret we share
       "The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and it
       was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment." In a
       talk equal parts eloquent and devastating, writer Andrew Solomon
       takes you to the darkest corners of his mind during the years he
       battled depression. That led him to an eye-opening journey across
       the world to interview others with depression — only to discover
       that, to his surprise, the more he talked, the more people wanted
       to tell their own stories. (Filmed at TEDxMet.)

       [50]Kevin Breel [51]Confessions of a depressed comic
       Kevin Breel didn't look like a depressed kid: team captain, at
       every party, funny and confident. But he tells the story of the
       night he realized that — to save his own life — he needed to say
       four simple words.

       Now playing
       [55]Sherwin Nuland [56]How electroshock therapy changed me
       Surgeon and author Sherwin Nuland discusses the development of
       electroshock therapy as a cure for severe, life-threatening
       depression — including his own. It’s a moving and heartfelt talk
       about relief, redemption and second chances.

       Now playing
       [60]Eleanor Longden [61]The voices in my head
       To all appearances, Eleanor Longden was just like every other
       student, heading to college full of promise and without a care in
       the world. That was until the voices in her head started talking.
       Initially innocuous, these internal narrators became increasingly
       antagonistic and dictatorial, turning her life into a living
       nightmare. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, hospitalized, drugged,
       Longden was discarded by a system that didn't know how to help her.
       Longden tells the moving tale of her years-long journey back to
       mental health, and makes the case that it was through learning to
       listen to her voices that she was able to survive.

       Now playing
       [65]Elyn Saks [66]A tale of mental illness -- from the inside
       "Is it okay if I totally trash your office?" It's a question Elyn
       Saks once asked her doctor, and it wasn't a joke. A legal scholar,
       in 2007 Saks came forward with her own story of schizophrenia,
       controlled by drugs and therapy but ever-present. In this powerful
       talk, she asks us to see people with mental illness clearly,
       honestly and compassionately.

       [70]JD Schramm [71]Break the silence for suicide attempt survivors
       Even when our lives appear fine from the outside, locked within can
       be a world of quiet suffering, leading some to the decision to end
       their life. At TEDYou, JD Schramm asks us to break the silence
       surrounding suicide and suicide attempts, and to create much-needed
       resources to help people who reclaim their life after escaping
       death. Resources: http://t.co/wsNrY9C

       Now playing
       [75]Kevin Briggs [76]The bridge between suicide and life
       For many years Sergeant Kevin Briggs had a dark, unusual, at times
       strangely rewarding job: He patrolled the southern end of San
       Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, a popular site for suicide
       attempts. In a sobering, deeply personal talk Briggs shares stories
       from those he’s spoken — and listened — to standing on the edge of
       life. He gives a powerful piece of advice to those with loved ones
       who might be contemplating suicide.
