   The Amazon River is like a heart, pumping water from the seas through
   it, and up into the atmosphere through 600 billion trees, which act
   like lungs. Clouds form, rain falls and the forest thrives. In a
   lyrical talk, Antonio Donato Nobre talks us through the interconnected
   systems of this region, and how they provide environmental services to
   the entire world. A parable for the extraordinary symphony that is
   nature.
