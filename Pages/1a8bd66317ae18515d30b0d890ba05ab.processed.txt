How To Take Control Of Your Reputation At Work

   The most important career capital you have isn’t your technical skills
   or academic pedigree. It’s not your high-flying title. It’s not even
   your relationships… It’s your reputation. In every job, people will
   wonder if you have what it takes to get things done and if you can deal
   with a wide range of people. They’ll be more than curious if you can
   handle crises and adversity. My favorite mentor has been known to
   caution, “Your reputation gets to the next place before you do….What
   will it be?”

   To take control of your own professional reputation, you need more than
   just good everyday performance. Consider the following simple but
   effective reputation-builders to improve your credibility at work:

   1. Don’t Go In Unprepared: Priscilla, a marketing up and comer was
   excited to get invited to a meeting by a departmental leader that she
   admired. Since she’d been busy with her ongoing projects, she quickly
   skimmed the pre-meeting materials that were sent around in advance. The
   problem was, when Priscilla got there, she asked a series of questions
   that were easily answered…had she carefully read the pre-meeting
   materials. This short interaction in front of a powerful and
   influential group led others to see her as “nice, but ill-equipped.”
   Think of your preparation time as something that translates to respect
   for your audience.

   2. Be consistent: Have you ever worked with someone who was
   [45]particularly moody—leading you to wonder which character you would
   get on a given day? Being known this way only frustrates people and
   worse, distracts them from your knowledge and talent. In contrast, I
   recently partnered with a client on some consulting work and was struck
   by the wonderfully competent young woman who supported the project. In
   each interaction I had with her, she was reliable, pleasant, and
   effective, offering insights above and beyond what she was asked to
   do. It was her consistency in every single medium from email, to
   in-person meetings—even voicemails—that made me think, “This woman
   won’t be in this role for long.”

   3. Keep Your Promises: Sometimes in our zeal to show our value to new
   people, we [48]overcommit to what we can do and leave the other side
   high and dry.  Imagine networking with a like-minded professional,
   making plans to partner on a joint project, and then never hearing from
   that person again. It may be easy to overpromise, but it’s very hard to
   recover your reputation totally when you mislead someone. The
   lesson? Don’t waste people’s hopes, time or energy by making
   commitments you won’t keep. I guarantee your forgotten deliverable or
   oversight will be more memorable to them than your pleasant
   personality!

   4. Buy Into Yourself:  If our body language is apologetic…if we don’t
   go for the higher-level job we think we’d be great in…if we [49]feel
   like imposters who don’t really deserve our job and title…than guess
   how others will see us? The foundation of a great reputation is
   believing you have something of value and importance to share and
   contribute. Without this essential ingredient, you may fly under the
   radar, never making enough noise to be noticed or seen. In my dozens of
   interviews with top women leaders, I heard frequently that a
   non-reputation—being a virtual unknown—can be as hard to overcome when
   it comes to advancement as having a faulty reputation.

   5. Don’t complain: When I interviewed the wonderful Fizzah Jafri, COO
   Fixed Income Research and Economics at [50]Morgan Stanley [51]Morgan
   Stanley, for my book [52]Pushback, she cautioned strongly against
   becoming known as someone [53]who’s impossible to please.  Said Jaffri,
   “You need to articulate your objection early on and then bounce back
   quickly. Don’t dwell on issues. The ‘complainer’ perception tends to
   stick . . . . Become known as a constructive thinker.’’ Consider some
   of the colleagues you most admire and I’d bet most of them know how to
   frame their ideas and objections with tact, and more importantly with a
   solution or suggestion for improvement.

   Gossiping, [54]triangulating—and not following the basic rules of your
   workplace—can certainly undermine your credibility.  But in the end
   it’s about more than just keeping composure or being nice.

   You need to manage your career like…it’s a VIP business project.  If
   something damages your credibility, act! Either take responsibility for
   that misstep or campaign for the issue to be seen in the right light.

   What do you see as a critical action in building a good reputation?
   What actions should we all avoid?
