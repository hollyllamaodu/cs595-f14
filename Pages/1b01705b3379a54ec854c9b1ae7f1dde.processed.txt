The Future Smart City Will Be Built Around You and the Internet of You

   [Steepsmall.jpg] Post written by Mike Steep

   Senior vice president of global business operations at PARC and
   distinguished visiting scholar at Stanford University.

   Pssshhhhhhtttt. Like a shot of steam in your morning latte, the sound
   of train doors opening injects vitality into any urban commute. But
   imagine that at 7:18 a.m. on Monday in the London Underground the red
   doors stay open and quiet, and stay, and stay . . .

   Inside the rail cars, instead of the familiar sway and howl of a train
   at pace, there’s just a nervous electrical hum. Londoners sit, yawn,
   and scroll absently on their phones. Tired of waiting, a couple of
   would-be passengers make a decision to tuck away their phones and head
   back out onto the platform.

   Now what?

   The commuters have no idea why their train is delayed or when or if it
   will move again. So they’re forced into a scavenger hunt for an
   alternate way to work.

   To be fair to London, this experience is rapidly becoming extinct. The
   city upon the Thames is growing faster than at any other time in its
   2,000-year history. According to the [46]City of London, the core will
   hit 9 million in population before New York and approach 10 million by
   2030. London is on track to become one of 30 megacities that will exist
   by 2023. So it is necessarily reinventing itself in the digital age as
   a Smart City.

   How does becoming a Smart City save the hapless riders stranded on the
   train? Imagine you’re a commuter in a different scenario. Sensors
   monitoring the Tube and its trains detect an irregularity in the brake
   system of your usual train. The data gets reported in real time to the
   government agency Transport for London (TfL), checked with a
   probability heuristic, and confirmed. There’s a 90% chance of brake
   failure in the next two hours.

   No problem. Before you can leave a tip for the barista at your favorite
   coffee house, a text message alerts you to the delay and offers you an
   alternative route, as well as a coupon for a discount on your next cup
   of coffee. All compliments of the City of London and TfL. Apps like
   [47]Citymapper are already taking the first toddling steps toward this
   ideal.

   That’s why the current model of a Smart City as an extended Internet of
   Things is inadequate. It leaves out the most critical component—you,
   the digital citizen. You are not just a thing, but the reason the
   system exists. There can be no useful vision of a city, smart or
   otherwise, that doesn’t place you at its center.

   So, then, what is a smart city? And what are the implications for the
   people who live within its bounds? To truly make the most of what a
   city can be, planners, companies, and urban dwellers need to understand
   three critical things:

   1. You don’t just live in a city; you cross through its layers every
   day.

   In the simplest view, cities have three layers:  the underground level,
   the surface, and the airspace. In a Smart City there’s a corresponding
   parallel universe of data-collecting sensors integrated within each
   stratum.

   Take, for example, the underground. Like trees with a massive root
   system, cities are figuratively and literally supported by a vast
   subterranean physical complex—transportation, heat, sewers, fresh
   water, electricity, communications, and structural supports. Today
   these systems are being augmented with sensors, digital arrays, and
   hubs to monitor every aspect of their activity. If the earth shakes,
   whether from a train or a seismic event, the data will be accurately
   captured.

   The next layer is the surface. Think of streets, parks, plazas, and
   even the retail shops, restaurants, and other buildings or entrances
   normally accessible from street level. At this layer the parallel
   digital network includes cameras, location-based services, cellular
   networks, and sensors monitoring everything from traffic to the pace of
   pedestrians.

   The final layer is airspace. Skyscrapers, bridges, and towers hold
   aloft sensors that monitor wi-fi, weather, air quality, and perhaps
   even drone traffic.

   So why is it important to think about the strata of the city? Because
   humans cross through each layer every day. Any technology solution that
   fails to anticipate and account for people is, at the outset, a hobbled
   initiative. The truly connected city begins to emerge in how data is
   managed across all three physical layers. Data analytics becomes the
   glue that, when managed well, dramatically improves your experience of
   life.

   2. You will be the active, mobile center of a vast network.

   We’re used to thinking of ourselves as part of a social network, but
   done right, Smart Cities promise to put each of us at the center of
   far-reaching civic and commercial networks, too. Points of connection
   will be everywhere—smartphones, clothing, cars, benches, buildings,
   parking meters, speed bumps, shop windows, and more. Pass by your
   favorite clothing boutique and your jacket alerts the store, flashing a
   special price on the window just for you.
   Of course, smart doesn’t just mean opportunistic sales. The kind of
   porous and flexible connection required for usability argues for a
   whole new level of data security and privacy. A truly smart city must
   take into account social policy and how it translates into protection
   for its citizens. The good news is that as points of connection
   proliferate, so will your choices about when and how to interact with
   the network.

   3. You will have the power to shape your experience of the city.

   In another futuristic example, imagine acting as a kind of living
   thermostat to regulate the temperature of your city. On the surface
   during rush hour, above certain key transit hubs, the temperature of
   the sidewalk can soar up to 20 degrees higher than the surrounding
   environment. What if city managers could transfer that heat from
   underground into the buildings above? Instead of energy escaping into
   the atmosphere, buildings could reduce their heat consumption and
   improve their carbon footprint. Take it a step further, and thousands
   of commuters could voluntarily alter their routes to promote heat
   exchanges and maybe even receive energy tax credits.

   Cities have always shaped their inhabitants. The élan vital can
   manifest in an accent, the pace of service, or even how much time
   people spend outdoors. But this may be the first time in history that
   an individual citizen will have the power to push back on and shape her
   city in real time. We’re reaching a new level of engagement—a kind of
   symbiotechna.

   In coming articles, we’ll look more closely into the specifics of Smart
   Cities and the tremendous creative potential for sustainability,
   livability and commercial impact. Smart means a safer, healthier,
   cleaner, and even joyful city. Always with you at its heart.
