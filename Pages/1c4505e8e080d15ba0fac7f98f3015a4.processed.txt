Chart of the Week: Where We Stand on Equal Pay for Equal Work
       [158]Tanya Somanader
       [159]Tanya Somanader
       August 28, 2014

       Ninety-four years ago this week, American women officially won the
       right to vote when the United States certified the 19th Amendment
       to the Constitution. The fight to secure that intrinsic right took
       generations, and nearly 100 years later, women continue to face
       persistent inequality and discrimination.
       In 2014, women are still fighting to make the principle of equal
       pay for equal work a reality. Though more and more women are
       becoming the primary breadwinners in their families, they continue
       to make less than their male counterparts at all income levels -- a
       gender pay gap that only widens as people get older.
       In fact, women who enter the workforce after graduating college are
       paid less in almost every field of study:
       By age 65, the average woman will have lost $431,000 over her
       working lifetime because of the earnings gap. For women of color,
       that disparity is even wider.
       This persistent wage discrimination is not only an affront to our
       founding principles of equality, it is a significant drag on our
       economy. If women received the same pay as their male counterparts,
       our economy would produce $447.6 billion in additional income.
       President Obama has taken action to close this gap, starting with
       the[160] first bill he signed into law, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair
       Pay Act. This legislation gives employees the time necessary to
       confirm wage discrimination and to challenge continuing pay
       discrimination without being penalized if they aren’t initially
       aware of the discrimination.
       The President also [161]took executive action to strengthen
       enforcement of equal pay laws:
          + An Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors from
            retaliating against employees who choose to discuss their
            compensation, thereby helping workers discover potential
            violations of equal pay laws and seek appropriate remedies.
          + A Presidential Memorandum that establishes new regulations
            requiring federal contractors to submit data on employee wages
            that includes data by sex and race. The Department of Labor
            will use this data to encourage compliance with equal pay
            laws.
       But the President cannot act alone. Congress must help make equal
       pay a reality by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation
       that would ensure that the standards President Obama is putting
       forward by his executive action apply to all employers across the
       country. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans have already blocked
       action on this legislation three times and Republicans continue to
       block action in the House.
       Women have made significant strides over the past 94 years,
       becoming leaders in almost every facet of American life. But there
       is more work to do to ensure that women receive the equal rights,
       equal treatment, and equal opportunity they deserve to reach their
       potential. Because when women succeed, America succeeds.

       Betsey Stevenson who has laid out exactly how far women have come
       in 94 years, and what we still have left to accomplish.
