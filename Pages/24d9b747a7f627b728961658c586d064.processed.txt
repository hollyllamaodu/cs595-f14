   the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field, presented by BDO by
   the Numbers, as compiled by Redskins Public Relations.

   "Redskins-Eagles Monday Stats Pack" is [50]presented by BDO by the
   Numbers. People who know, know BDO.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [51][BDO_Logo_crop.jpg]

   Team:

     * The Washington Redskins fell to the Philadelphia Eagles, 37-34, in
       front of an announced crowd of 69,596 people at Lincoln Financial
       Field on Sunday.
     * The Redskins had two receivers accumulate 100 receiving yards in
       the same game for the first time since Laveranues Coles (180) and
       Rod Gardner (118) accomplished the feat at Atlanta on Sept. 13,
       2003.
     * The Redskins gained 511 net yards, a season high and the team’s
       first 500-yard effort since posting 500 total yards vs. San Diego
       in Week 9 last season.
     * Including a 449-yard effort last week vs. Jacksonville, the
       Redskins have now posted at least 400 yards of offense in two
       consecutive games for the first time since doing so in three
       straight games from Weeks 9-11 last season.
     * The Redskins opened the game with an 11-play, 77-yard touchdown
       drive culminating in a four-yard touchdown pass from Cousins to
       fullback [52]Darrel Young [icon-article-link.gif] .
     * The opening-drive touchdown was the Redskins’ first since Dec. 1,
       2013 vs. the New York Giants.
     * The 14-point first quarter was the Redskins’ first since Week 2 of
       the 2012 season at St. Louis.
     * Excluding a kneeldown to end the half, the Redskins scored on every
       possession in the first half for the first time since Week 10 at
       Minnesota last season.
     * The Redskins gained 253 net yards in the first half. The Redskins
       have exceeded 250 first-half yards in two of their three games this
       season. The team accrued 250 first-half yards twice in 16 games
       last season.
     * The Redskins scored 20 first-half points at Philadelphia a week
       after scoring 21 first-half points vs. Jacksonville, marking the
       first time since Weeks 1-2 of the 2012 season that the Redskins had
       scored 20 points in the first half of consecutive games.
     * The Redskins did not allow a sack for the first time since Week 16
       last season vs. Dallas.
     * The Redskins entered a game as the No. 1 ranked total defense in
       the NFL for the first time since entering Week 10 of the 2004
       season as the league’s top-rated unit.
     * Despite the loss, the Redskins remain 81-73-5 against the Eagles
       all-time, including postseason play. The Redskins’ 82 wins against
       the Eagles are their most against any opponent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Offense:
     * Quarterback [53]Kirk Cousins [icon-article-link.gif] recorded his
       first start of the season and finished the game having completed
       30-of-48 passes for 427 yards with three touchdowns and a passer
       rating of 103.4.
     * Cousins recorded career highs in completions (30), passing yards
       (427) and passing touchdowns (three). His previous highs in all
       three categories came in Week 15 last season at Atlanta.
     * Cousins’ 427 passing yards were the fourth-most by a Redskins
       quarterback in a regular season game since the 1970 merger,
       trailing Brad Johnson (471 on Dec. 26, 1999), Mark Rypien (442 on
       Nov. 10, 1991) and Doug Williams (430 on Sept. 11, 1988).
     * Cousins’ 400-yard passing day was the first of his career and the
       first by a Redskins quarterback since Donovan McNabb vs. Houston on
       Sept. 19, 2010 (426).
     * Running back [54]Alfred Morris [icon-article-link.gif] gained 77
       yards on 23 carries and entered the Top 10 in career rushing
       yardage in Redskins history, surpassing Don Bosseler (3,112).
       Morris now has 3,141 career rushing yards.
     * Wide receiver [55]DeSean Jackson [icon-article-link.gif] returned
       to Lincoln Financial Field after appearing in 87 career regular
       season games with the Eagles across the 2008-13 seasons.
     * Jackson posted a season-high 117 receiving yards on five receptions
       with one receiving touchdown in his return. The 100-yard receiving
       game was the 21st of Jackson’s career and his first with the
       Redskins.
     * Wide receiver [56]Pierre Garçon [icon-article-link.gif] posted
       season highs with 11 receptions for 138 yards with one receiving
       touchdown. The 11 receptions tied his career high set in Week 16
       last season vs. Dallas.
     * The 100-yard receiving game was the 14th of Garçon’s career and his
       eighth with the Redskins.
     * Young's touchdown was his third in as many games this season
       (rushing touchdown in Week 1 at Houston, receiving touchdown in
       Week 2 vs. Jacksonville). It marks the first time in Young’s career
       he has scored a touchdown in three consecutive games.
     * Cousins completed his first eight pass attempts of the game. Last
       week, Cousins completed his first 12 attempts – a personal best for
       consecutive completions – vs. Jacksonville.
     * On the Redskins’ second drive, Cousins connected with Garçon for a
       four-yard touchdown pass.
     * Cousins’ first quarter performance marked the first time a Redskins
       quarterback had thrown two first-quarter touchdown passes since
       Mark Brunell vs. the New York Giants on Dec. 24, 2005.
     * In the third quarter, Cousins connected with Jackson for an 81-yard
       touchdown pass. The pass was a career long for Cousins, surpassing
       a 77-yard touchdown pass to [57]Santana Moss
       [icon-article-link.gif] on Oct. 7, 2012.
     * The touchdown was Jackson’s first with the Redskins and the 33rd of
       his career. The 81-yard reception was the third-longest of his
       career and his longest since a 91-yard touchdown reception at
       Dallas on Dec. 12, 2010, as a member of the Eagles.
     * The touchdown was Jackson’s 18th total touchdown covering 50 yards
       or more in his career, the most in the NFL since he entered the
       league in 2008.
     * The 81-yard completion was the Redskins’ longest since [58]Robert
       Griffin III [icon-article-link.gif] hit Garçon for an 88-yard
       touchdown in Week 1 of the 2012 season. The 81-yard pass was the
       longest allowed by the Eagles since Oct. 18, 2009 (86 at Oakland).
     * The touchdown pass was Cousins’ third of the day and the 13th of
       his career. His three passing touchdowns matched his career high
       set in Week 15 last season at Atlanta.
     * Running back Roy Helu, Jr. recorded a career-long 55-yard reception
       in the fourth quarter. Three plays later, Helu, Jr. finished the
       drive with a one-yard touchdown run, the seventh rushing touchdown
       of his career and his first of the season.
     * Cousins finished the first half with a passer rating of 123.4,
       marking the seventh time since 1991 a Redskins quarterback finished
       a first half with at least 10 attempts and a passer rating in
       excess of 120.0. He was the first to do it since he accomplished
       the feat in Week 15 at Atlanta last season (141.3 rating on 20
       attempts).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Defense:
     * Cornerback [59]DeAngelo Hall [icon-article-link.gif] recorded his
       first fumble recovery of the season in the second quarter,
       recovering the first forced fumble of rookie cornerback [60]Bashaud
       Breeland [icon-article-link.gif] ’s career.
     * The fumble recovery was the 14th of Hall’s career and the eighth of
       his tenure with the Redskins.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Special Teams:
     * Kicker [61]Kai Forbath [icon-article-link.gif] converted his 17th
       and 18th consecutive field goal attempts, dating back to last
       season, the longest streak of his career. In the process, he
       surpassed himself for second in team history (17 in 2012).
     * Forbath set the streak in the same stadium in which he converted
       his NFL record 17th consecutive field goal to open a career in
       2012.
