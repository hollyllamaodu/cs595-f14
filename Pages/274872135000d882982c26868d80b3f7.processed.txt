   How can we begin to address the global, insidious problem of climate
   change — a problem that’s too big for any one country to solve?
   Economist Nicholas Stern lays out a plan, presented to the UN’s Climate
   Summit in 2014, showing how the world’s countries can work together on
   climate. It’s a big vision for cooperation, with a payoff that goes far
   beyond averting disaster. He asks: How can we use this crisis to spur
   better lives for all?
