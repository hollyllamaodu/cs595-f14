[8]Cloud, HPC And Open Technologies Converge To Fuel Research, Innovation

   When you put leaders of industry, research, and academia in a room for
   a day, what do you get? If you were at [9]Argonne National Laboratory
   last month for the workshop on resource intensive open clouds, you got
   a taste of progress. The workshop was organized by leaders from
   [10]Notre Dame University, [11]Internet2, and [12]Rackspace, in the
   interests of figuring out the next steps for the technical computing
   world, bridging old-world high performance computing with the new-world
   of cloud computing.
   I was invited to this workshop on behalf of the PSF, and was excited by
   the prospect of being involved in an open and collaborative
   environment, tasked with figuring out how all of these sides of the
   story could come together. Many of the attendees are using
   [13]OpenStack, an open cloud computing platform implemented in Python,
   and Python was a key technology for many of them in other ways. It
   looks like OpenStack-based and community-owned open clouds will likely
   become key points as the group progresses towards a better landscape to
   solve their computing needs, and if the past is any indication, Python
   will remain an important piece of the software powering it.
   "The pace of innovation is accelerated and the diversity of solutions
   and approaches ensures that good solutions persist and not so good ones
   are quickly identified," said event organizer Paul Rad of Rackspace, on
   the topic of open and transparent workshops like this one.
   My hope for this group is that future workshops can leverage some of
   our leaders in Python's large scientific community, many of whom are
   undoubtedly facing the challenges this workshop set out to improve on.
   Feel free to contact me at [14]brian@python.org if you're interested in
   contributing to future efforts.
   For more details on the workshop, see Paul's post on the subject
   at [15]http://www.rackspace.com/blog/cloud-hpc-and-open-technologies-co
   nverge-to-fuel-research-innovation/. If you are interested in learning
   more about this initiative and/or in participating in future workshop
   sessions, please email [16]OpenCloud@internet2.edu.
