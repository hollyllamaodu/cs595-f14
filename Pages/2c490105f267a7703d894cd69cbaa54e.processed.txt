       [45]Andy Puddicombe [46]All it takes is 10 mindful minutes
       When is the last time you did absolutely nothing for 10 whole
       minutes? Not texting, talking or even thinking? Mindfulness expert
       Andy Puddicombe describes the transformative power of doing just
       that: Refreshing your mind for 10 minutes a day, simply by being
       mindful and experiencing the present moment. (No need for incense
       or sitting in uncomfortable positions.)

       [50]Jarrett J. Krosoczka [51]Why lunch ladies are heroes
       Children’s book author Jarrett Krosoczka shares the origins of the
       Lunch Lady graphic novel series, in which undercover school heroes
       serve lunch…and justice! His new project, School Lunch Hero Day,
       reveals how cafeteria lunch staff provide more than food, and
       illustrates how powerful a thank you can be.

       [55]Kathryn Schulz [56]On being wrong
       Most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong. But what if we're
       wrong about that? "Wrongologist" Kathryn Schulz makes a compelling
       case for not just admitting but embracing our fallibility.

       [60]Phil Hansen [61]Embrace the shake
       In art school, Phil Hansen developed an unruly tremor in his hand
       that kept him from creating the pointillist drawings he loved.
       Hansen was devastated, floating without a sense of purpose. Until a
       neurologist made a simple suggestion: embrace this limitation ...
       and transcend it.

       [65]Jennifer 8. Lee [66]The hunt for General Tso
       Reporter Jennifer 8. Lee talks about her hunt for the origins of
       familiar Chinese-American dishes — exploring the hidden spots where
       these two cultures have (so tastily) combined to form a new
       cuisine.
