8 Job Search Tips For Unemployed Executives

   By Howard Seidel, [46]Next Avenue Contributor

   Executives who’ve been out of work for more than a year and are looking
   for jobs face two big challenges: They’re competing with employed
   professionals, as well as applicants who’ve been out of work for less
   time.

   But a year is not an unusually long time to be out of work for execs.
   The [47]average length of unemployment for them is nine to 12
   months. It takes executives longer, on average, because they often have
   [48]non-compete clauses in their severance agreements preventing them
   from working for a competitor for a year; there are fewer executive
   jobs than non-exec jobs and employers vet these candidates slowly
   because they’re costly.

   (MORE: [49]Why Rejections Are Good for Job Hunters)

   Here are eight job search tips to speed up the landing time for
   long-term unemployed executives:

   1. Give yourself benchmark targets to reach. Unemployed professionals
   need to evaluate their [50]job searches at regular intervals: three
   months, six months, nine months, etc.  At each milestone, they need to
   ask themselves the following questions to help diagnose potential
   problems with their search or barriers preventing them from securing
   interviews and offers:
     * What’s going well in my job search?
     * What isn’t going well and needs changing?
     * Am I getting responses to [51]my résumé?
     * Am I getting first interviews but not second interviews?
     * Am I making it to the final rounds of interviews but not getting
       offers?

   2. Simplify your job-search documents so employers can find you. Always
   use the same naming format structure — first and last name —for your
   resumé, [52]LinkedIn profile and email address. If your personal email
   address is something like thefamilybunch@gmail.com, create a new
   account for your job search, such as BobSmith@gmail.com. That way,
   employers an quickly find communications from you in their email
   inboxes.

   (MORE: [53]How to Find Work After 50)

   Also, when you update and save your résumé and cover letters, follow
   this same format naming structure, instead of
   “coverletter_4_xyz_company.” Then, HR personnel, hiring managers and
   recruiters will find your documents in their system more quickly and
   easily.

   3. Keep active and network through [54]volunteering or contract work.
   Many employers consider job seekers who’ve been unemployed for a long
   time as spoiled goods who’ve lost their competitive edge. That’s why
   it’s smart to keep having some kind of work — it could be a consulting
   gig, a contract position or a good volunteering assignment at a
   nonprofit.

   Working in some way demonstrates to employers that you’re active and
   provides a current narrative when you’re asked during job interviews
   what you’ve been doing while unemployed. In addition, it might provide
   some income to ease the burden of having to take that first job
   offer. Always add interim work to your resumé — even if it’s unpaid.

   4. Brag a bit to show you’re in demand. If you’ve been a serious
   candidate for a few jobs and have received offers that for some reason
   didn’t come to fruition, subtly communicate this to potential
   employers.  Hiring managers like it when candidates they’re considering
   are sought after.

   An ideal time to mention these offers is when the interviewer asks if
   you have anything going on. Then, casually mention that you’ve been on
   some interviews and have had a few offers you unfortunately had to
   decline. Be honest, and explain why you didn’t accept the positions
   (they were out of state…you didn’t think they were the best fit…),
   since it’s often a “small world” in which you’re interviewing.

   5. Whatever you do, don’t let them see you sweat. Never give the
   impression to prospective employers (or to people in your network) that
   you’re desperate for a job. Desperation is never an attractive trait.
   When an employer calls and asks: “Can you come for an interview on
   Friday?” don’t say, “Sure, what time? The whole week’s open.”

   6. Reconsider your options. Early on during a search, job seekers tend
   to be selective about the position they want and its location. But if
   you’ve been out of work for awhile, you should ask yourself every few
   months if it’s time to expand or change your interests.

   The single most effective thing you can do to increase the number of
   job opportunities is to broaden your geographic parameters. Executives
   engaged in national searches tend to land jobs faster than those
   looking regionally. Also, consider alternate job titles or roles you’d
   be willing to take, maybe even an entirely new career path.

   7. Be prepared to answer tough [55]interview questions. Hiring managers
   tend to be rougher on candidates who’ve been out of work for a year or
   more. You might be probed on the circumstances surrounding your
   departure from your last job, for example.
   So before your next interview, prepare an honest, non-aggressive answer
   to the question, “Why did you leave your last job?” such as: “a merger
   or acquisition eliminated my position” or “a new CEO came on board and
   brought in a new management team” or “the company closed my office and
   my family and I were unable to relocate.”

   Never offer an answer expressing anger or spite, such as “They hired a
   new CEO and I didn’t like him.” You need to frame your departure from
   your last job in the best possible light. The response should convey
   that you’re competent, have a strong work history and integrity and are
   a solid leader.

   8. Remember that almost good enough can turn out to be good. Some job
   seekers hold out for the perfect position, which only prolongs
   unemployment.  Never forget that no job is perfect and a job you’ve
   been offered may well be a good next step.
