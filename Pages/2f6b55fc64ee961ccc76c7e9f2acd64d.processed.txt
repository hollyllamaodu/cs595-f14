French President: Islamic extremists beheaded French hostage

   By Steve Almasy and Pierre Meilhan, CNN
   updated 3:34 PM EDT, Wed September 24, 2014
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * NEW: French President Francois Hollande says he has assurances
       Algeria will seek justice
     * Herve Gourdel, in his late 50s, was a mountaineer
     * France won't back down against terrorism, Hollande says
     * President Obama issues condolences for beheaded French hostage

   (CNN) -- French hostage Herve Gourdel was abducted and beheaded, a
   killing shown on video, French President Francois Hollande told the
   United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.

   "You will understand that today I am speaking before you with a
   particularly high level of emotion because one of my compatriots has
   just been subject of a cowardly assassination," Hollande said. "He was
   a man who was full enthusiasm. He loved the mountains. He thought he
   would be able to pursue his passion moving into the Ouzou area in
   Algeria."

   Hollande said the attack won't affect France's role in the battle
   against terrorism.

   "France will never give in to blackmail, to pressure, to barbaric acts.
   Quite to the contrary, France knows what is expected," Hollande said.

   Earlier, Hollande expressed his condolences to Gourdel's family in a
   news conference at the French mission.

   Obama: We stand with France against ISIS

   Gourdel was kidnapped over the weekend in Algeria's Tizi Ouzou region
   east of Algiers, the French Foreign Ministry said. The video was posted
   online Wednesday. It shows armed men who claim to belong to Islamist
   militant group Jund al-Khilafa -- or Soldiers of the Caliphate -- in
   Algeria. They pledge allegiance to [41]Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader
   of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

   Titled "A message of blood for the French government," the video
   surfaced as French Prime Minister Manuel Valls addressed the French
   National Assembly, the country's lower house of parliament, about the
   fight against ISIS.

   France is part of a broad coalition that is working with the United
   States to combat the brutal extremist group.

   According to his website, Gourdel was born in 1959 and when he was a
   teenager decided he wanted to become a mountain guide. He opened a
   guide office in Saint Martin-Vésubie in 1987 where he spent more than
   20 years, the website says. He was also an active member of a
   mountaineering club that spent time in France's Mercantour National
   Park.

   The Algerian government called the beheading an act of "criminals."

   "It is with a lot of sorrow and sadness that the Algerian government
   has learned about the horrible assassination of French national Pierre
   Hervé Gourdel, an odious and despicable act committed by a group of
   criminals," officials said, according to the state-run Algerie Presse
   Service news agency.

   Hollande said he spoke with Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal,
   who assured Hollande he would commit a maximum effort to find the
   killers and Gourdel's body.

   "We owe it to his family," Hollande said.

   [43]READ: The anatomy of ISIS

   The video appears to show the latest beheading of a Westerner by an
   Islamist extremist group. Since mid-August, ISIS has beheaded American
   journalists [44]Steven Sotloff and [45]James Foley and British aid
   worker [46]David Haines.

   The new video came on the same day U.S. President Barack Obama
   addressed the United Nations, calling for all countries to unite
   against terrorism and brutality wrought by ISIS. The Islamic State in
   Iraq and Syria goes against everything Islam stands for, he said.
   Islam, Obama said, is about peace.

   Obama publicly extended the condolences of the United States to the
   people of France for the death of Gourdel.

   The U.N. Security Council issued a statement condemning the "heinous
   and cowardly murder."

   CNN's Brian Vitagliano, Sara Mazloumsaki, Elwyn Lopez, Ashley Fantz and
   Jason Hanna contributed to this story.
