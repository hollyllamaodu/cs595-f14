Amazon Begins Contacting Developers For Secret Smart Home Projects

   By Aaron Tilley and [48]Ryan Mac

   [49]Amazon.com [50]Amazon.com has recently begun reaching out to
   developers to build relationships for its secret smart home projects,
   according to at least one person familiar with the conversations.

   “Amazon is looking at this space very intently,” said the person who
   wished to remain anonymous to protect his relationship with the
   company.

   The Seattle retailer is ramping up efforts by pouring $55 million into
   its Silicon Valley engineering center, Lab126. As first reported today
   by [51]Reuters, Amazon signed a deal with California that will stretch
   that spending over a five-year period and lead to an increase of 798
   employees. The plan was revealed in [52]a June 19 document with the
   California Governor’s Office of [53]Business and Economic Development
   (GO-Biz) and showed a $1.2 million tax credit awarded to Amazon
   subsidiary A2Z Development Center, Inc.

   California’s listing of the project labels the center as “electronic
   device research & development.” Reuters reported that the expansion
   will focus on testing various connected home hardware.

   Amazon, which is reportedly already testing a device that allowed users
   to order products from their home with the click of a button, will be
   going to head-to-head with fellow technology giants [54]Apple [55]Apple
   and [56]Google [57]Google in the smart home space. Though the the
   e-commerce company is in the very early days of its projects, its
   success will likely come down to Amazon’s ability to connect with
   developers and startups that have already flooded the space
   with connected thermostats, light bulbs and garage door openers.

   Realizing the importance of relationships with smart home startups
   Nest, which was bought by Google for $3.2 billion at the beginning of
   this year, recently opened APIs for outside developers.
   Similarly, Apple announced HomeKit in June as its protocol for
   connecting third-party home devices together on its proprietary iOS
   operating system.

   Amazon is still in the early stages of this experiment, according to a
   person in discussion with Amazon, so it’s still uncertain if its
   products will ever hit the market. But the move into the smart home
   makes plenty of sense for the company. A presumed device could
   potentially deliver new data from within the home, allowing the company
   to better understand the needs of their customers. Amazon can also
   leverage its cloud infrastructure in Amazon Web Services to collect,
   store and streamline that data.

   Amazon’s Lab126 is the company’s renowned Silicon Valley-based
   skunkworks that developed the company’s Kindle readers and worked on
   its recent FireTV and Fire Phone products. Dave Limp, Amazon senior
   vice president of devices, said in an August interview with FORBES that
   the lab was responsible for building parts of the Fire Phone’s
   cameras—which contribute to the device’s unique 3-D image features—and
   operating system.

   “We wake up everyday and think about how to build world class devices
   and world class software to power those devices,” he said.

   While sales of the Fire Phone have been flat, leading the Seattle-based
   company to slash the price of the phone to 99 cents, Amazon
   continues to explore new device and product categories to add to its
   core e-commerce business. Based on financial filings, Amazon’s research
   and development spending has increased every quarter for the last 17
   quarters.

   Recently the company also [58]hired Babak Parviz, a former director at
   secretive research lab Google X who was among the pioneers of Google
   Glass. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed Parviz’ hiring but did not
   comment on his new role at the company.

   The [59]website for Lab126, which was founded in 2004, explains how the
   skunkworks was named and could offer an explanation behind the A2Z
   title as well.

   “The Lab126 name originated from the arrow in the Amazon logo, which
   draws a line from A to Z in ‘Amazon,’ ” reads the website. “In Lab126,
   the 1 stands for ‘A’ and the ‘26’ stands for ‘Z.’ The subsidiary
   functions as an Amazon lab of innovation, research, and development for
   consumer electronics products, drawing the best minds in Silicon Valley
   together.”

   As far as Amazon’s smart home plans, Amazon spokesperson
   Kinley Pearsall said that the company doesn’t comment on rumors or
   speculation.
