   Ecologist Deborah Gordon studies ants wherever she can find them — in
   the desert, in the tropics, in her kitchen ... In this fascinating
   talk, she explains her obsession with insects most of us would happily
   swat away without a second thought. She argues that ant life provides a
   useful model for learning about many other topics, including disease,
   technology and the human brain.
