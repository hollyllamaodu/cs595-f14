   This session is full. Would you like to be added to the waiting list?
   By waitlisting any session you cannot schedule another session in the
   same time slot unless you remove yourself from the waiting list. If you
   are first in line on a waiting list for a session and a seat becomes
   available, then the session will be added to your schedule and you will
   receive a confirmation email. Your pre-enrollment for sessions will be
   validated onsite. We will hold your pre-enrollment until 10 minutes
   prior to the session start time, at which point your seat may be given
   to someone else if you are not present. Anyone not pre-enrolled for a
   session may be asked to wait in a stand-by line.
