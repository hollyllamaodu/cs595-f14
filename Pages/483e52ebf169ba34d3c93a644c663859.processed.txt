U.S. Companies Leading to Reduce Emissions of HFC Climate Pollutants
       [158]John Podesta
       [159]John Podesta
       September 16, 2014
       02:18 PM EDT
       Share This Post
       Today, fulfilling a commitment under the President’s [160]Climate
       Action Plan, the Obama Administration is announcing new private
       sector commitments and executive actions to reduce emissions of
       hydroflourocarbons (HFCs), powerful greenhouse gases that
       exacerbate climate change.  Taken together, these commitments will
       reduce cumulative global consumption of HFCs by the equivalent of
       700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2025. That’s an
       amount equal to 1.5% of the world’s 2010 greenhouse gas
       emissions—or, in other words, it’s like taking nearly 15 million
       cars off the road for 10 years.
       HFCs, used primarily in air conditioning and refrigeration, are
       greenhouse gases with up to 10,000 times the global warming
       potential of carbon dioxide. Unless we act, U.S. emissions of these
       potent greenhouse gases would nearly double by 2020 and triple by
       2030.
       Announced today, U.S. industries are leading the way in helping
       fulfill the President’s pledge by investing billions of dollars to
       develop and deploy the next generation of safe, cost-effective
       alternatives to HFCs, and by incorporating these climate-friendly
       technologies into the cars, air conditioners, refrigerators, foams
       and other products they manufacture and use.
       Across the entire HFC supply chain, from production to
       manufacturing to retail, American businesses large and small are
       committing to phase down HFCs and accelerate the uptake of
       climate-friendly alternatives. For example, industry groups are
       pledging to support policies to reduce global HFC emissions, to
       increase research and development spending, and to develop and
       commercialize HFC alternatives. Chemical companies are pledging to
       phase down the manufacturing of HFCs and to accelerate production
       of HFC alternatives. Beverage companies and retailers are pledging
       to buy HFC-free equipment. For a full list of companies and
       commitments, please check out [161]our fact sheet.
       The Obama Administration is also announcing new federal actions to
       increase the uptake of safer alternatives to HFCs and encourage the
       development of new technologies by:
          + Promoting HFC alternatives within the federal government,
            including by updating regulations for contractors and
            evaluating more sustainable options in federal buildings.
          + Encouraging private sector investment in low-emissions
            technology, including expanding the list of climate-friendly
            HFC alternatives and organizing sector-specific workshops.
          + New research and development funding from the Department of
            Energy, to encourage next generation, climate- and
            ozone-friendly cooling and heating, ventilation, and air
            conditioning systems.
       Moreover, earlier this summer, the Environmental Protection Agency
       proposed two new rules under the Significant New Alternatives
       Policy (SNAP) Program that would smooth the transition to
       climate-friendly alternatives to HFCs, including expanding the list
       of acceptable alternatives and limiting the use of some of the most
       harmful HFCs where alternatives are available.
       All of these actions add to the gathering momentum toward an
       amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the landmark international
       agreement signed 27 years ago today to phase out the use of
       chemicals harmful to the ozone layer, to tackle HFCs on a global
       scale. Recent studies show the hole in the ozone layer is closing,
       and reinforce the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol to phase
       down harmful pollutants. Importantly, the U.S. and China have
       already agreed to work together to phase down the consumption and
       production of HFCs, and G-20 leaders followed suit by expressing
       their own support for similar measures.  And just yesterday, former
       Indian Minister of Environment Jairam Ramesh [162]called for his
       country to join a global effort to phase down HFCs under the
       Montreal Protocol.
       The leadership demonstrated today by U.S. industries and the
       federal government taking on HFCs is welcome news for the planet
       and will help prompt other countries and companies to take action
       on climate change.
       John Podesta is Counselor to the President.
