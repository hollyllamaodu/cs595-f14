   Just like his beloved grandfather, Avi Reichental is a maker of things.
   The difference is, now he can use 3D printers to make almost anything,
   out of almost any material. Reichental tours us through the
   possibilities of 3D printing, for everything from printed candy to
   highly custom sneakers.
