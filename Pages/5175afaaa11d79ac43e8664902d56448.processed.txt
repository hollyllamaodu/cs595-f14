     * [49]Climate change gives rise to tough times
    Ranching and farming livelihoods are being thrown into instability,
       insecurity, and uncertainty.

       The consequences of climate change are detailed in the news with an
       abundance of numbers concerning shortfalls in rain, extreme
       droughts, and record-high temperatures. But statistics and data
       fail to show the tax and torment that occurs for the farmers and
       ranchers like me whose livelihood is at stake.
       My world has been centered on that type of living since growing up
       on my family’s cattle ranch in northern New Mexico. That ranch
       helped shape the person I am today, a farmer and horse veterinarian
       in Mora County, New Mexico. The difference between now and then is
       the debilitating blow the new weather norms have had on our work.
       [a025257d23eb49258df56379c4da7c16_DougNM_large.jpg] Intense heat
       and frequent droughts are the new challenges I have to face. The
       snowmelt from the southern Rockies, which has sustained our farming
       and ranching operation for over 40 years, has diminished due to the
       gradually withering snow pack. Our streams used to run deep with
       run-off for months this time of year, but they are just trickles
       now. It is heartbreaking.
       When I was a kid, we could produce 15,000 bales of grass and
       alfalfa hay a year. For the last five years, we have averaged just
       1,500 bales. Our ranch used to support 250 mother cows, but they
       all had to go because the lack of water made our grasses
       increasingly unproductive and incapable of supporting that many
       cattle.
       Incidences of disease that correlate with the changing weather have
       been another crippling blow to the livestock. Cases of Pigeon Fever
       spike in dry weather, and cases of the vesicular stomatitis virus
       increase in warm weather. Those have hit our horses and cattle hard
       during these extraordinarily brutal summers. During one of the
       severe dry spells last summer, we had a herd of 130 elk die
       mysteriously.
       I wonder if my family farm would have survived for 42 years if
       today's conditions had existed back then. Ranching has always been
       a tough job, but these new conditions have made it even more
       difficult. Ranching has never been a way to make a lot of money
       even in the best-case scenario, but now it is simply unsustainable.
       I'm sharing my story to bring awareness to the consequences of
       climate change in hopes of inspiring people to take action.
