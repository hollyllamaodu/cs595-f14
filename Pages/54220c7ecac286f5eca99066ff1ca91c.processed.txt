   Rita Pierson, a teacher for 40 years, once heard a colleague say, "They
   don't pay me to like the kids." Her response: "Kids don't learn from
   people they don’t like.’” A rousing call to educators to believe in
   their students and actually connect with them on a real, human,
   personal level.
