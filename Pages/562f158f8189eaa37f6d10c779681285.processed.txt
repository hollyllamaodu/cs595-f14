Growing Our Economy and Strengthening Our Financial System
       [158]Jeffrey Zients
       [159]Jeffrey Zients
       September 15, 2014

       Six years ago today, Wall Street was rocked by a financial crisis
       that culminated in the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, the
       largest in U.S. history. The financial crisis resulted in the
       longest and deepest recession the American economy had experienced
       in 60 years. While more work remains to continue digging out of the
       deep hole that was left by the crisis, this week offers a chance to
       reflect on the significant progress that has been made since then
       in strengthening the economy and reforming the financial sector.
       To understand how far we have come, it is important to remember the
       dark days that marked the beginning of the financial crisis. In the
       span of a few weeks in 2008, many of our nation's largest financial
       institutions failed or were acquired to avoid insolvency. Capital
       markets froze, and the availability of credit for mortgages,
       student, auto, and small business loans was drastically reduced.
       The recession ultimately eliminated nearly 9 million jobs,
       threatened the American auto industry, and shrank the economy by
       hundreds of billions of dollars. The crisis was the result of many
       factors, including an overvalued housing market, predatory lending
       practices, thinly capitalized financial institutions that took big
       risks, and a regulatory system that was outdated and unequipped to
       meet modern challenges.
       When President Obama came into office in January 2009, the
       Administration worked quickly to put our economy on the path to
       recovery. Facing a potential collapse, the federal government
       launched a coordinated effort to tackle the financial crisis on
       several fronts. Early efforts included broad-based guarantees of
       bank accounts and money market funds to prevent runs that would
       have exacerbated an already deteriorating situation, and
       unprecedented liquidity from the Federal Reserve. Through the
       [160]Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the government took
       decisive action to mitigate threats to the financial system that
       would have further impacted the economy. Today, it is clear that
       the TARP program was a success. Without the government’s forceful
       response, the damage would have been far worse, and the costs to
       repair the damage would have been far higher.
       Under the President’s leadership, the federal government helped
       rescue the American auto industry from collapse and saved more than
       a million jobs. At the peak of the financial crisis, GM and
       Chrysler were on the verge of collapse, which would have impacted
       businesses up and down the supply chain, including many small
       businesses. Moreover, since Chrysler and GM emerged from bankruptcy
       in mid-2009, the auto industry has added more than 481,000 jobs,
       the industry’s strongest job growth since the 1990s.
       The Administration also launched several initiatives to help
       millions of struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure, keep mortgage
       rates low, and facilitate refinancing. Additional assistance was
       provided to the hardest hit areas of the country, allowing those
       states to implement programs that were locally tailored to their
       needs.
       Since the financial crisis, we have made significant progress
       toward a safer and sounder financial system. President Obama
       proposed the most sweeping reforms of the financial system since
       the Great Depression, leading to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank
       Wall Street Reform and the Consumer Protection Act. As a result,
       financial markets are more resilient, consumers are better
       protected, and the financial system is better prepared to withstand
       shocks. With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the
       Administration and independent regulators have worked hard to
       implement reforms that provide better protections for taxpayers and
       our economy, and set sensible rules of the road to foster
       well-functioning financial markets that fuel growth, help the
       private sector create jobs, and better serve the American people.
       Moreover, we now have greater transparency and oversight over the
       financial system as well as tools to end “too big to fail” that did
       not exist during the financial crisis. Additionally, the
       finalization of the Volcker Rule will change banks’ behavior and
       limit excessive risk-taking.
       At the same time, the Administration has moved aggressively to
       protect consumers and ensure that financial products meet the needs
       of working families. With the creation of the [161]Consumer
       Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), consumers now have a dedicated
       watchdog within the federal government focused on financial
       products and services.
       As a result of CFPB’s efforts, Americans shopping for a mortgage
       can now rest assured that mortgage lenders will make a good faith
       and reasonable effort to ensure their products are affordable. And
       no longer do they have to wade through many pages of confusing and
       overlapping federal disclosures to understand the terms and cost.
       CFPB ensures that lenders comply with these important protections
       through investigations and enforcement actions.
       Today, our economy is experiencing a comeback thanks to the
       resilience and determination of American workers and businesses.
       Over the past 54 months, businesses have added [162]10 million new
       jobs, the longest stretch of private-sector job growth in our
       nation’s history. Home prices are showing consistent upward growth,
       bringing 4 million households out of negative equity in 2013 alone,
       and the number of seriously delinquent mortgages is at the lowest
       level since 2008. Real GDP grew by a robust 4.2 percent annual rate
       in the second quarter of this year. Auto sales are at their highest
       level since 2006, and the major measures of consumer sentiment are
       at or near their post-recession highs.
       We know we have made progress, but there is still more to be done
       to continue to grow our economy and support our middle class
       families. That is why the President’s economic agenda includes
       closing tax loopholes, expanding educational opportunities, and
       raising the minimum wage. These and other steps will not only
       strengthen the recovery in the near-term, but also lay the
       foundation for stronger, more sustainable growth in the years to
       come.
