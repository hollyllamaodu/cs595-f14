   Charles Adams began his service career with Public Allies in
   Washington, DC, in 1995 at the New Community After School Program.
   During this service, he noted that, “Unbeknownst to me, AmeriCorps
   would be my road map and my guide.”

   Charles' experiences working with children through Public Allies led to
   a 20-year career as an educator in Brooklyn, NY, Philadelphia, and in
   Washington, DC, where he is now the head of the SEED Public Charter
   School.
   Benjamin Blonder - profile picture
   Benjamin Blonder
   AmeriCorps | 2008 to 2009

   Dr. Benjamin Blonder co-founded the University of Arizona’s Sky School,
   a residential science school that provides inquiry-based environmental
   education on a campus located in the heart of the Coronado National
   Forest. Because of his efforts, each year hundreds of K-12 students,
   primarily from Title I schools, are now able to conduct independent
   research while exploring the unique ecology, geology, and astronomy
   resources of the region. These experiences are key for inspiring and
   preparing a more diverse next generation of scientists and conservation
   leaders.

   Benjamin’s vision for the Sky School was inspired by his AmeriCorps
   service in central Idaho at the McCall Outdoor Science School, a
   National Science Foundation-supported teaching fellowship in a Tucson
   public school, and his long-term volunteer leadership with the Sierra
   Club’s Inner City Outings program, which provides opportunities for
   urban youth to experience nature. He recently received his Ph.D. in
   ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of Arizona.
   Christina Bodison - profile picture
   Christina Bodison
   AmeriCorps VISTA | 2013 to 2014

   As Christina Bodison navigated a demanding course load at Howard
   University, the former biology major actively searched for ways to be
   of service to others.  First, she mentored high school students during
   an alternative spring break program in Detroit. Then, she researched
   HIV, AIDS, and the socioeconomic factors that bar access to health
   care. All of this compelled Christina to join the AmeriCorps VISTA
   program and the fight against poverty, and she is urging other to do
   the same.

   “I was presented with so many opportunities that allowed me to see the
   importance of service,” she said. “I learned about giving back to the
   community I live in.”

   As an AmeriCorps VISTA member and volunteer coordinator for the
   Baltimarket “Virtual Supermarket” Program, Christina found new ways to
   link residents to healthy and affordable food. Christina managed a team
   of community volunteers, known as neighborhood food advocates, who help
   shoppers with transportation challenges submit and pick up their
   orders. Through this Baltimore City Health Department initiative, she
   helped raise awareness about the link between poverty and health.
   Blair Brettschneider - profile picture
   Blair Brettschneider
   AmeriCorps VISTA | 2010 to 2011

   Blair Brettschneider didn’t plan on creating her own nonprofit. But
   something she imagined had never been done before. So Blair decided to
   make a change.

   That’s when the 25-year-old launched what is now [97]GirlForward, an
   organization that offers mentorship and educational opportunities for
   girls who have been uprooted from their war-torn countries. Blair
   credits her experience with the [98]AmeriCorps VISTA program for
   exposing her to the plight of refugee youth and their families.

   Blair served as an AmeriCorps VISTA member from 2010 to 2011. As part
   of her responsibilities, she completed fundraising development projects
   at [99]RefugeeOne, a refugee resettlement agency in Chicago.

   GirlForward, a once modest enterprise, has now grown to one that has
   served more than 100 girls. In fact, the organization’s success
   prompted media giant CNN to name her one of its top 24 CNN Heroes for
   2013.

   Still, Blair’s newfound celebrity has not fully resonated yet.

   “When I see people sitting in the office I think, ‘Wow this is an
   actual organization,’” Blair said. “I’m really proud of everything that
   we’ve done and I’m also really thankful for all of the support we’ve
   received.”
   Jon Brito - profile picture
   Jon Brito
   AmeriCorps | 2010 to 2013

   Jon Brito served three AmeriCorps terms with Kupu's Hawaii Youth
   Conservation Corps from 2008 to 2013, as a team member, team leader,
   and a year-long intern. During these terms, Jon engaged the local youth
   and community members on the rural island of Moloka'i in critical
   environmental community service and indigenous cultural practices.
   Jon's commitment to serving the island's land and people has helped
   protect and restore countless endangered native Hawaiian species and
   habitats, perpetuate native Hawaiian knowledge and culture, and has
   inspired other local youth and community members to take an active part
   in the conservation movement on Molokai. Currently, Jon is a fellow in
   Kupu's RISE Program, where he is finding ways to make agri-businesses
   more energy efficient. He is also completing the Electronic and
   Computer Engineering Technology Program at the University of Hawaii's
   Maui Campus.
   Alex Bryan

   Alex Bryan, Garden Project Program Manager, Greater Lansing Food Bank,
   Michigan
   AmeriCorps Alums 20th Anniversary National Leadership Award Winner

   Alex served in 2005 and 2010 with CA Conservation Corps and Greater
   Lansing Food Bank, respectively. His experience with the outdoors and
   the food bank in his two years of AmeriCorps service has led to him
   managing a community garden support program (100+ community gardens
   helping 7,000 people access food through gardening), and a farm
   business development program for lower-income residents and refugees
   who want to start small farm businesses. In addition, Alex serves as
   Board President of the National Young Farmers Coalition, which works to
   lower the barriers to entry into farming. He also co-owns a 4-acre
   urban farm in the city of Detroit called Food Field. “I learned that
   the desire to accomplish tasks you set for yourself far outweighs the
   difficulty in actually accomplishing them. With that and a strong team
   and good leadership, the most difficult of things can be done.
   Kevin C. Miller
   Kevin C. Miller
   AmeriCorps VISTA | AmeriCorps Alum Winner
   Kevin C. Miller, Strategic Partnership Associate with Swords to
   Plowshares
   AmeriCorps Alums 20th Anniversary National Leadership Award Winner

   Kevin (service began in 2013 with Swords to Plowshares) is a former
   Sergeant in the Marine Corps infantry and multiple-tour Iraq combat
   veteran. During his time in service, he sustained multiple traumatic
   brain injuries and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.
   These factors made Kevin’s transition from military to civilian life
   difficult. Kevin struggled in his personal life becoming unemployed
   with multiple DUIs. He found a new direction through an AmeriCorps
   VISTA volunteer position with Swords to Plowshares in California. His
   experience with AmeriCorps reminded Kevin to “redefine what it means to
   be ‘successful.’ You cannot dwell on what you cannot change, but you
   can use your ‘failures’ as motivation to drive towards your own
   definition of success.” After his service, Swords to Plowshares created
   a full-time position for Kevin within the Institute for Veteran Policy,
   and Resource Development & Communications Departments as the Strategic
   Partnership Associate where he ensures fellow veterans get the services
   and support they need to prevent chronic homelessness, poverty and
   untreated mental and physical health issues.
   Brandon Cardet-Hernandez

   AmeriCorps NCCC | AmeriCorps Alum Winner
   Brandon Cardet-Hernandez, Principal at Urban Assembly Bronx Academy of
   Letters and Co-Founder of Project Nathanael

   AmeriCorps Alums 20th Anniversary National Leadership Award Winner

   Through AmeriCorps and the New York City Teaching Fellows program
   (service began in 2007), Brandon strengthened his passion for social
   justice by focusing his work on equity and access in education. Brandon
   has experience as a teacher, as the Director of Strategic Initiatives
   under Chancellor Dennis Walcott (NYC Department of Education), and now
   as a principal in the South Bronx at the Urban Assembly Bronx Academy
   of Letters. Among other activities, he has led student organizations
   like the school Gay-Straight Alliance and Student Government and
   developed deep and rich relationships with students and families,
   leading to students’ impressive gains in and outside of the classroom.
   Brandon is committed to service in education because, he says, “when we
   strategically nurture young people, we are fighting against racial and
   economic injustice, leading us to develop the next generation of
   thoughtful, caring, ambitious and service-minded global citizens.”
   Brandon also co-founded Project Nathanael, a nonprofit that has
   developed and supported a tuition free, co-ed school in Port-au-Prince,
   Haiti.

   Germain Castellanos
   AmeriCorps | 2004 to 2005

   Germain Castellanos served in AmeriCorps as a Youth Developer with the
   Youth Conservation Corps in Waukegan, IL, where he was honored with the
   title of AmeriCorps Member of the Year in 2005. He has served since
   2008 as Program Director for the SHINE Educational Leadership Program,
   a workforce development program serving over 300 at-risk youth at
   Waukegan High School—where the student population is more than 70
   percent Latino. Germain’s transition from being a recipient of services
   to a provider of services for at-risk youth earned him the Illinois
   Governor’s Journey Award in 2008. The son of immigrants from Mexico,
   Germain also works to create change and opportunity for the residents
   of his hometown of Waukegan by serving as Vice President of the Habitat
   for Humanity Lake County Board of Directors; Program Chair and Member

   AmeriCorps Alums 20th Anniversary National Leadership Award Winner

   In the 20 years since he was sworn in, William (service began in 1994
   with Texas Youth Harvest as a high school senior) shares, “I have
   carried the AmeriCorps commitment and pledge with me every day over the
   past 20 years and am very glad that I can say that I have been getting
   things done since my swearing in.” William, who went on to earn a law
   degree, has worked in business development at the U.S. Embassy in
   Buenos Aires, facilitated international education and real estate
   opportunities for global organizations, led national service reviews
   with the Corporation for National and Community Service, and worked
   with both sides of the political aisle to build renewable energy and
   economic development projects for his home state of New Mexico.
   Jorell “Joey” Diaz - profile picture
   Jorell “Joey” Diaz
   AmeriCorps | 2012 to 2014

   Jorell “Joey” Diaz was born in 1991 into an unstable household. He was
   adopted by his grandparents, whom he lost at the young age of eight.
   Joey then entered the foster care system in the South Bronx, joining a
   house of eight children. During his freshman year of high school, he
   dropped out of school along with his foster brother, who had become his
   best friend. One day while Joey was skipping school, he witnessed his
   foster brother die from a stray bullet. This devastating experience
   motivated him to re-enroll in high school and graduate on time. Joey
   got a full scholarship to attend Trinity College in Hartford, CT, and
   graduated in 2013 with a degree in Education and Urban Studies. Putting
   his degree to use, Joey joined City Year New York in the summer of
   2013. He served as an AmeriCorps member at PS/MS 57 in East Harlem, NY,
   where he partnered with teachers to help keep students in school and on
   track to succeed. After completing his first service year, Joey
   returned to City Year as a Senior AmeriCorps Member and Team Leader at
   the same school, where he continues to serve today.

   George Dong, Director of Operations at Teach For America Chicago,
   Founder of Education in Sight
   AmeriCorps Alums 20th Anniversary National Leadership Award Winner

   Through his experiences as a Teach For America corps member, George
   (service began in 2009) found his passion lies in the intersection of
   public service and education. “AmeriCorps was not a short-term
   commitment but a lifetime commitment to service,” George says. While
   serving in the inner city of Chicago for two years, he was awarded the
   Teacher of the Year award in recognition of his dedication to education
   and to each of his students' academic success. George is now the
   Director of Operations at Teach For America Chicago. George has also
   started Education in Sight, a nonprofit aiming to give all low-income
   communities access to quality eye-care services. Today, Education in
   Sight has served more than 20,000 students. George was awarded Teach
   For America's social innovation award and the Yale School of

   Deenie Espinoza, Online Academic Advisor and Success Coach for The
   Learning House
   AmeriCorps Alums 20th Anniversary National Leadership Award Winner

   Deenie began her chapter with Pima Family Literacy in Arizona as a GED
   student, and then became their first AmeriCorps member in 1994. After
   one year as a member, she joined their staff and led advocacy efforts
   for Arizona adult education and family literacy programs. She obtained
   her Bachelor of Science in Education and is currently pursuing her
   master’s degree. In her current position as an Online Academic Advisor
   and Success Coach for The Learning House, she is mentoring and guiding
   students to help them reach their goals. “As an AmeriCorps member, I
   learned as much as I needed to know about servant leadership,” she
   says. “As an AmeriCorps alum, I carry that spirit of volunteering still
   with me today. I know I’m connecting with a community in a meaningful
   way when I’m planting trees, providing financial literacy coaching or
   working side by side with others in a neighborhood cleanup.”
   John Fetterman - profile picture
   John Fetterman
   AmeriCorps | 1995 to 1997

   John Fetterman was attracted to Braddock, PA, by the town's tragic arc
   of history and malignant beauty. Founded around the site of Andrew
   Carnegie's first steel mill, Braddock's fortunes declined in lockstep
   with the American steel industry. As the town's population fell from a
   peak of more than 20,000 to just 2,300, its buildings, infrastructure,
   and economy unraveled. With 90 percent of everything lost – population,
   buildings, homes, and businesses – the challenges seemed
   insurmountable. John, an AmeriCorps alumnus and Harvard graduate with a
   Master's Degree in Public Policy, moved to Braddock in 2001.

   Four years later John became the town's mayor – winning the election by
   a single vote  –  and has been at the forefront of a massive effort to
   revitalize the once- prosperous town ever since. In 2009, John won a
   second term by nearly a 3-to-1 margin. A relentless advocate for
   reimagining and redesigning Braddock, Mayor Fetterman's focus on
   creating safer a safer, most just Braddock, youth-oriented programs,
   attracting artists and other “creatives" to his community and to

   Ely Flores
   AmeriCorps |

   My story is common for a child raised in a single-parent household in
   an under-resourced and disenfranchised community. My father abandoned
   my family when I was young and, in my neighborhood, young offenders
   were more often sent to prison than to rehabilitation programs. I grew
   up in south Hollywood and South Central Los Angeles. Lacking a steady
   home life, I took to the streets and found violence as the only way to
   face my daily problems. My gang lifestyle eventually led to
   incarceration. I was in and out of prison for four years, until I
   realized that staying out of the penal system for good meant making
   profound changes in my life.

   It is deeply important for youth who are in the challenging situation I
   once faced – being out of school and out of work – to know that there
   are organizations and individuals in every community that care about
   providing support needed to lead a life of success and integrity.  For
   me, this support came through two AmeriCorps programs: LA CAUSA
   YouthBuild and Public Allies.

   LA CAUSA YouthBuild came into my life at age 17 when I was still in
   prison and about to become a father. The people at YouthBuild
   introduced me to self-accountability as I struggled to experience a
   positive transformation. They didn’t define me according to past
   crimes, but rather, embraced me with acceptance and trust.

   My development was by no means a quick process. I needed a safe space
   in which to grow and make mistakes. I needed time to develop confidence
   and self-awareness. Without the support of a role model and mentor, I
   could not have taken the steps necessary to improve my life. My
   YouthBuild program director, Alejandro Covarrubias, spoke to us on our
   level—he knew how to gain our trust and respect. Alejandro became a
   friend and a mentor to all of the young people in my cohort. He was
   never the “director” or the decision-maker – he was just another human
   being connecting with us.

   My time with Public Allies allowed me to see others who looked like me
   and were taking on the challenge of getting an education and developing
   leadership skills. They inspired me to do the same. AmeriCorps members
   helped me to understand that I had a voice that could be used to engage
   public leaders and pursue change.  It was the positive influence of my
   peers that helped me turn my ideas into transformative social action
   including providing affordable housing for homeless and low-income
   people in my community.

   Today, I am an activist. I have a passion for community organizing and
   providing youth with leadership development opportunities. I believe in
   solution-based social justice.  One of my contributions has been
   founding Leadership through Empowerment, Action and Dialogue (LEAD) in
   Los Angeles, California, which has trained more than 200 underresourced
   youth in legal education, social justice, and community activism.

   There are many people who tell youth, “You are the future.” While I
   believe in empowering youth, I don’t believe this is the right
   message.  I believe that we are the now—not just the future. We need
   only one person to believe in us and show us the way. There are others
   like me who want to be a part of the community and contribute to it in
   positive ways.

   I once heard that “Mistakes are a part of being human. Appreciate your
   mistakes for what they are – precious life lessons that can only be
   learned the hard way.” I live my life encouraging others to learn from
   their mistakes and to approach situations with the solution-oriented
   spirit that helped me get off the track of violence and crime, and into
   a life of public service.

   My path is a testament to the notion that it’s possible to turn your
   life around if you’re given the chance.  I live to make sure that
   others have the same opportunity.

   Dialogue Inc. in Commerce, CA.

   Sondra Samuels, President and CEO of Northside Achievement Zone, NAZ
   AmeriCorps Alums 20th Anniversary National Leadership Award Winner

   Sondra (service began in 1994, Justice Department's Weed and Seed
   Initiative) learned two big takeaways from her time in AmeriCorps.
   First: Place matters. She believes living where you serve is the
   ultimate in connection to any struggle. She now lives and works in
   North Minneapolis, a community where disparities abound, and where
   families and children are isolated by race and income. It is a place
   where African Americans and people of color are disproportionately
   impacted by failing schools, community violence,  poor housing and
   diminished access to employment, healthy foods and transportation. Her
   second takeaway is the understanding that we are each born into a
   universal mission to do our part to make our country and world better.
   Sondra says, “I believe, as Frantz Fanon, the African philosopher, so
   eloquently stated, ‘Each generation, out of relative obscurity, must
   discover its mission, fulfill it or betray it.’"   Sondra also served
   in the U.S. Peace Corps in Botswana, Africa through the Small
   Enterprise Development Program from April 1992 to May 1994.

   Amanda Washington
   AmeriCorps | 2009 to 2011

   Armed with a degree from Spelman College and the institution’s motto “a
   choice to change the world,” Amanda Washington set out to do just that
   by serving as an AmeriCorps member with Teach for America. With doctors
   and lawyers in her family line, Amanda —the great-great-granddaughter
   of Booker T. Washington—yearned to chart her own course in the field of
   education.

   After being accepted as an AmeriCorps member in 2009, she embarked on
   her first teaching experience at a public high school in Philadelphia.
   This experience prepared Washington for her next teaching role in
   Washington, DC. While teaching English as a second language at DC Prep
   charter school, she helped many students overcome their language
   barriers.

   Now Amanda uses the lessons she learned in AmeriCorps in her current
   endeavor as a graduate student at Columbia University’s Teachers
   College.  And this summer, she is serving as a graduate student intern
   with the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African
   Americans.

   “My experience as an AmeriCorps member helped me realize that education
   is not just about lesson plans,” Amanda said.

   AmeriCorps Alums 20th Anniversary National Leadership Award Winner

   Roger's (service began in 2003, Massachusetts Promise Fellowship)
   personal experiences as an immigrant to the U.S. and witnessing the
   death of a friend in the September 11 attacks inspired him to serve in
   AmeriCorps. His lifetime of service has continued over the years as
   he's created safe spaces for young people at the Seeds of Peace Camp,
   collaborated with the community to reduce youth violence in Boston,
   worked as a Philanthropy Manager at Charles Schwab and eBay, and worked
   to drive change in the U.S. and abroad at the intersection of business,
   government, and social sectors. Roger reveals, “the confidence, skills,
   and sense of accomplishment I gained in my first year of service opened
   my eyes and heart,” and was the key to “empowering me to overcome a
   traumatic past and changing the trajectory of my career and life.”

   Tyler Wright
   AmeriCorps VISTA | 2013 to 2014

   As a hospital corpsman who constructed facial prosthetics in the U.S.
   Navy, Tyler Wright helped wounded, ill, and injured service members
   reclaim a part of their identities that was lost during their journeys
   abroad. When he returned to civilian life last year, Tyler looked for
   something that would aid his own reentrance to his community. Less than
   15 days after leaving the Navy, AmeriCorps VISTA offered him the type
   of opportunity he had imagined.

   As an outreach and communications coordinator with Student Veterans of
   America, Wright connects nearly 1,000 veterans-focused student
   organizations across the country to grant and funding sources. This
   effort ultimately helps strengthen these organizations so they can
   serve more former service members.

   Tyler is certain that his commitment to service will not end with
   AmeriCorps VISTA. With future plans to pursue biomedical research and
   teaching in higher education, Tyler is currently in a master’s degree
   program in therapeutic herbalism: the study of the properties of plant
   medicine.

   “As I help out other vets, I learn more about myself,” said Tyler. “It
   just seems like it was somehow planned out that way for me to be here
   and I’m very thankful for it.”
