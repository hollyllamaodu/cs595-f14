   Who are the hackers?
   The Internet connects us as never before, but there's a dark side to
   this web. Who are the hackers who wreak havoc online? And what is it
   they want? Sociologists, criminologists and hackers themselves shed
   light …

       [45]Keren Elazari [46]Hackers: the Internet's immune system
       The beauty of hackers, says cybersecurity expert Keren Elazari, is
       that they force us to evolve and improve. Yes, some hackers are bad
       guys, but many are working to fight government corruption and
       advocate for our rights. By exposing vulnerabilities, they push the
       Internet to become stronger and healthier, wielding their power to
       create a better world.

       [50]Mikko Hypponen [51]Fighting viruses, defending the net
       It's been 25 years since the first PC virus (Brain A) hit the net,
       and what was once an annoyance has become a sophisticated tool for
       crime and espionage. Computer security expert Mikko Hyppönen tells
       us how we can stop these new viruses from threatening the internet
       as we know it.

       [55]Misha Glenny [56]Hire the hackers!
       Despite multibillion-dollar investments in cybersecurity, one of
       its root problems has been largely ignored: who are the people who
       write malicious code? Underworld investigator Misha Glenny profiles
       several convicted coders from around the world and reaches a
       startling conclusion.

       [60]Ralph Langner [61]Cracking Stuxnet, a 21st-century cyber weapon
       When first discovered in 2010, the Stuxnet computer worm posed a
       baffling puzzle. Beyond its sophistication loomed a more troubling
       mystery: its purpose. Ralph Langner and team helped crack the code
       that revealed this digital warhead's final target. In a fascinating
       look inside cyber-forensics, he explains how — and makes a bold
       (and, it turns out, correct) guess at its shocking origins.

       [65]Avi Rubin [66]All your devices can be hacked
       Could someone hack your pacemaker? At TEDxMidAtlantic, Avi Rubin
       explains how hackers are compromising cars, smartphones and medical
       devices, and warns us about the dangers of an increasingly
       hack-able world. (Filmed at TEDxMidAtlantic.)

       [70]Catherine Bracy [71]Why good hackers make good citizens
       Hacking is about more than mischief-making or political subversion.
       As Catherine Bracy describes in this spirited talk, it can be just
       as much a force for good as it is for evil. She spins through some
       inspiring civically-minded projects in Honolulu, Oakland and Mexico
       City — and makes a compelling case that we all have what it takes
       to get involved.

       [75]Todd Humphreys [76]How to fool a GPS
       Todd Humphreys forecasts the near-future of geolocation when
       millimeter-accurate GPS "dots" will enable you to find pin-point
       locations, index-search your physical possessions ... or to track
       people without their knowledge. And the response to the sinister
       side of this technology may have unintended consequences of its
       own. (Filmed at TEDxAustin.)

       [80]Guy-Philippe Goldstein [81]How cyberattacks threaten real-world
       peace
       More and more, nations are waging attacks with cyber weapons —
       silent strikes on another country's computer systems that leave
       behind no trace. (Think of the Stuxnet worm.) Guy-Philippe
       Goldstein shows how cyberattacks can leap between the digital and
       physical worlds to prompt armed conflict — and how we might avert
       this global security hazard. (Filmed at TEDxParis.)

       [85]Amy Webb [86]How I hacked online dating
       Amy Webb was having no luck with online dating. The dates she liked
       didn't write her back, and her own profile attracted crickets (and
       worse). So, as any fan of data would do: she started making a
       spreadsheet. Hear the story of how she went on to hack her online
       dating life — with frustrating, funny and life-changing results.
