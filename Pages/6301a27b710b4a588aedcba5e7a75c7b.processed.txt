'I'm gay. Get over it,' Pennsylvania senator casually comes out

   By Ed Payne, CNN
   updated 9:46 PM EDT, Wed September 24, 2014
   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Senator's coming out is more of an afterthought
     * Sen. Jim Ferlo was announcing a proposed change to the state's hate
       crime law
     * "I'm gay. Get over it," he says
     * Three suspects in the beating of a gay couple have been charged

   (CNN) -- It was one of those oh-by-the-way moments -- an afterthought
   really. It wasn't supposed to be a coming out party.

   Sure, the subject matter was serious, but in the end the mood was
   lighthearted.

   Lawmakers gathered in the Pennsylvania state capital in Harrisburg on
   Tuesday to propose a major change in the state's hate crime law to
   extend protection to those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or
   transgender.

   Lawmakers made their pitch for getting the legislation to the
   governor's desk by the end of the year.

   Then bill sponsor, Sen. Jim Ferlo of Pittsburgh, made his surprise
   announcement -- very casually.

   "Hundreds of people know I'm gay. I just never made an official
   declaration," he said. "I never felt I had to wear a billboard on my
   forehead. But I'm gay. Get over it. I love it. It's a great life."

   The announcement capped a momentous day for the LGBT community.

   Earlier, charges were filed against three people in the recent beating
   of a gay couple in Philadelphia.

   All are charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly
   endangering another person and criminal conspiracy, [41]CNN affiliate
   WPVI reported. They could not be charged with a hate crime for the same
   reason lawmakers held their news conference -- people who are lesbian,
   gay, bisexual or transgender are not covered under Pennsylvania's hate
   crime law.

   Kevin J. Harrigan, 26, Kathryn G. Knott, 24, and Phillip Williams, 24,
   surrendered to police on Wednesday, [42]according to WPVI.

   Later, Ferlo, who will be leaving the state Senate in November, said
   his remarks weren't planned.

   "It was totally impromptu. I've never denied it. I've never felt the
   need to talk about it," he told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.
