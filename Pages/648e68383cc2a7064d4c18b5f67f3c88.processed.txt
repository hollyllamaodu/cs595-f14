Out Of Office In An Always-On World: 4 Tips For Managing Email

   [42]Northwestern MutualVoice Team [43]Northwestern MutualVoice Team
   , Northwestern Mutual

   Ah, France: the land of wine, cheese, love … and a ban on after-hours
   work email? Not quite.

   When an article in the British press incorrectly reported that the
   French government had signed into law a new rule banning employees from
   checking work emails after 6 p.m., it set off a flurry of debate around
   the issue of work/life balance. This became something of a storm in a
   teacup since it turns out that no such legislation exists.

   What actually happened was that French union leaders and employers in
   the high-tech and consulting field signed an agreement protecting the
   rights of so-called “autonomous employees” (workers whose contracts are
   based on days worked, not hours) to receive the full minimum rest
   periods already mandated by France’s strict employment regulations. The
   law isn’t new, but as union leader Michel de La Force commented in the
   French edition of [44]The Local, the agreement was forged to help
   ensure that “an employee who does not open his emails on his time off
   cannot be criticized.”

   Out Of Office In An Always-On World 4 Tips For Managing Email

   The French are not alone in worrying about how cellphones and other
   portable devices are exposing workers to ever-longer hours. At the
   beginning of 2012, Volkswagen reached an agreement with a portion of
   its German workforce to stop the email server from sending emails to
   employees with smartphones 30 minutes after their shift ended and to
   restore service a half hour before work began the next day.

   The average American works about 7.9 hours a day, according to the
   Bureau of Labor Statistic’s 2014 [45]American Time Use Survey. But that
   figure doesn’t take into account the time many spend reading and
   responding to emails from home. The Center for Creative Leadership
   issued a white paper in August 2013, [46]Always On. Never Done?, that
   found that executives, managers and professionals (EMPs) who carry
   employer-provided smartphones interact with the office a whopping 13.5
   hours each business day. Assuming they sleep an average 7.5 hours a
   night (the amount recommended by experts to manage stress), this leaves
   just three hours a day during the week to do everything else.

   Maybe Volkswagen and the French unions are onto something after all?

   Putting in place rules about after-hours email access may please those
   who prefer to segment their work and non-work lives. But it’s likely to
   frustrate the nearly eight in ten (79 percent) U.S. workers who, in an
   April 2014 Gallup poll, said that the ability to stay in touch remotely
   with the office is a positive development.

   If tuning out on email isn’t an option or even a goal, what can you do
   to tame its impact on your time and energy? Here are four tips for
   managing a bulging inbox.

   1. Fend off superfluous email. An obvious way to reduce the time you
   spend on email is to unsubscribe to e-newsletters (websites such as
   [47]unroll.me make this easy to do) and turn off notifications from
   social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. Another is to set clearer
   parameters around how often you want to receive “FYI” emails from
   colleagues and direct reports. However, one of the most effective ways
   to reduce the flow of email to your inbox is to control how often you
   send them yourself. To cut down on email, don’t hit “Reply All” unless
   everyone on your team needs to hear what you have to say. Similarly,
   resist the temptation to handle everything with email. Instead, handle
   big decisions and complex issues face to face or by phone. That way,
   you’ll avoid a tsunami of back-and-forth emails.

   2. Develop a system and stick to it. Productivity expert Ann McGurty is
   known for responding to every email she receives within 24 hours, but
   she doesn’t let email bog her down. Instead, she has a system that she
   developed to help corporate executives and their assistants avoid the
   time drain that email can quickly become. “Each time I check email, I
   start by deleting anything I can, whether it’s spam or whatever. I sort
   the remaining email by subject so that I’m only looking at the last
   message in a conversation. That way, if the problem is solved, I’m not
   wasting time reading the entire thread,” says McGurty. “Next, I reply
   to any messages that can be handled immediately. Then I tag the
   remaining email for further action or file them into appropriate
   folders.” For those who prefer not to deal with organizing their
   inboxes, there are email management services such as [48]SaneBox that
   automatically prioritize email for you.

   3. Give yourself a clean slate. If your inbox is overloaded with email,
   getting email under control can feel overwhelming. McGurty suggests you
   clear the decks by creating a new folder called “Old Inbox” and put
   your existing email in it. That way you’ll be able to handle new email
   more easily while still having access to the email that piled up
   before.

   4. Take an email sabbatical. Do you get antsy when you can’t check
   email? It might help to take a break from email for a day or two. A
   2012 study, [49]A Pace Not Dictated By Electrons: An Empirical Study of
   Work Without Email, found that employees who were cut off from email
   for a few days engaged in more face-to-face interactions with
   colleagues and reported that they “multitasked less, could focus for
   longer periods of time and felt less stressed.”

   Another suggestion McGurty offered for limiting email access after
   hours: “Don’t bring smartphones and other devices, including charging
   stations, into your bedroom. That way you won’t be tempted in the
   middle of the night to check email.” Sounds like an easier solution
   than moving to France.
