   Tell your lawmakers:

   No one who works full time in America should have to raise their family
   in poverty. It's time to raise the minimum wage.

Tell your lawmakers: It's Time to Give America a Raise

"What every American wants is a paycheck that lets them support their
families, know a little economic security, pass down some hope and optimism
to their kids. And that’s worth fighting for."

   – President Obama

   The federal minimum wage hasn't kept pace with the rising costs of
   basic necessities for working families, and today is worth even less
   than it was in the early 1980s. That means someone working full time
   for the federal minimum wage makes just $14,500 a year — which is below
   the poverty line for a family of four.

   Raising the minimum wage nationwide would benefit 28 million workers
   across the country, and lift nearly a million people out of poverty.
   These aren’t just teenagers at their first job — the average age of
   workers who would benefit is 35 years old.

   Despite support from 7 out of 10 Americans, lawmakers have failed to
   act.

   But momentum is on our side. So far in 2014, ten states and D.C. have
   enacted minimum wage increases, and many more states have legislation
   in motion to follow suit. We've seen state legislators from both sides
   of the aisle come together, because they know that putting more money
   in the pockets of working Americans means more spending at local
   businesses.

   President Obama led by example, raising the wage for all federal
   contractors by executive order. We've also seen business owners raise
   wages for their employees, because they know that workers who feel
   valued are more productive and less likely to leave their jobs.

   Higher wages are good for workers and business, and are key to a
   stronger economy that creates opportunity for all Americans.

   What's needed now is a strong show of support from people across the
   country, to let our lawmakers know: It's time to give America a raise.
