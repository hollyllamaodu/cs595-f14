       Now playing
       [45]Rita F. Pierson [46]Every kid needs a champion
       Rita Pierson, a teacher for 40 years, once heard a colleague say,
       "They don't pay me to like the kids." Her response: "Kids don't
       learn from people they don’t like.’” A rousing call to educators to
       believe in their students and actually connect with them on a real,
       human, personal level.

       Now playing
       [50]Christopher Emdin [51]Teach teachers how to create magic
       What do rap shows, barbershop banter and Sunday services have in
       common? As Christopher Emdin says, they all hold the secret magic
       to enthrall and teach at the same time — and it’s a skill we often
       don't teach to educators. A longtime teacher himself, now a science
       advocate and cofounder of Science Genius B.A.T.T.L.E.S. with the
       GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, Emdin offers a vision to make the
       classroom come alive.

       [55]Tyler DeWitt [56]Hey science teachers -- make it fun
       High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about a
       lesson plan on bacteria (how cool!) — and devastated when his
       students hated it. The problem was the textbook: it was impossible
       to understand. He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to
       ditch the jargon and extreme precision, and instead make science
       sing through stories and demonstrations. (Filmed at
       TEDxBeaconStreet.)

       Now playing
       [60]Dan Meyer [61]Math class needs a makeover
       Today's math curriculum is teaching students to expect — and excel
       at — paint-by-numbers classwork, robbing kids of a skill more
       important than solving problems: formulating them. In his talk, Dan
       Meyer shows classroom-tested math exercises that prompt students to
       stop and think. (Filmed at TEDxNYED.)

       Now playing
       [65]Ramsey Musallam [66]3 rules to spark learning
       It took a life-threatening condition to jolt chemistry teacher
       Ramsey Musallam out of ten years of “pseudo-teaching” to understand
       the true role of the educator: to cultivate curiosity. In a fun and
       personal talk, Musallam gives 3 rules to spark imagination and
       learning, and get students excited about how the world works.

       [70]Stephen Ritz [71]A teacher growing green in the South Bronx
       A whirlwind of energy and ideas, Stephen Ritz is a teacher in New
       York's tough South Bronx, where he and his kids grow lush gardens
       for food, greenery — and jobs. Just try to keep up with this New
       York treasure as he spins through the many, many ways there are to
       grow hope in a neighborhood many have written off, or in your own.

       [75]Kakenya Ntaiya [76]A girl who demanded school
       Kakenya Ntaiya made a deal with her father: She would undergo the
       traditional Maasai rite of passage of female circumcision if he
       would let her go to high school. Ntaiya tells the fearless story of
       continuing on to college, and of working with her village elders to
       build a school for girls in her community. It’s the educational
       journey of one that altered the destiny of 125 young women. (Filmed
       at TEDxMidAtlantic.)
