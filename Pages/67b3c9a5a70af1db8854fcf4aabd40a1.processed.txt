   Hailed as the greatest pickpocket in the world, Apollo Robbins studies
   the quirks of human behavior as he steals your watch. In a hilarious
   demonstration, Robbins samples the buffet of the TEDGlobal 2013
   audience, showing how the flaws in our perception make it possible to
   swipe a wallet and leave it on its owner’s shoulder while they remain
   clueless.
