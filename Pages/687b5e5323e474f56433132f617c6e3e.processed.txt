Jackson Scores TD In Philadelphia Homecoming

   Posted Sep 22, 2014

   [Andrew-Walkerjpg.jpg] Andrew Walker Lead Writer, Editor Redskins.com
   [47]@Redskins
     * [48]a
     * [49]a

Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson — who was named to three Pro Bowls in
his six seasons with the Eagles — caught a 81-yard touchdown Sunday against
his former team.

   The main storyline all week leading up to Sunday’s Redskins-Eagles
   matchup in Philadelphia was whether or not Redskins wide receiver
   [50]DeSean Jackson [icon-article-link.gif] could overcome a sprained
   left shoulder to make his first-ever appearance against his former team
   — not to mention in front of his former home crowd.

   Jackson — who didn’t even participate in practice until Friday — was a
   gametime decision on Sunday, but ended up playing through the pain to
   turn in his best performance in a Washington uniform to date, catching
   five passes for 117 yards and a long touchdown in the Redskins’ 37-34
   loss to the Eagles.

   “Out there, I am just trying to help my team win the game and I’m going
   to give everything to give a great effort,” Jackson said after the
   game. “I think it was a great game and credit to the other team who
   also did a great job, but we fought all the way to the end. It’s just
   unfortunate that we did not win the game.”

   It didn’t take long for Jackson — who was released by the Eagles in
   March — to learn both those in the crowd and his opponents on the field
   would be less-than-brotherly on Sunday.

   On the Redskins’ first drive of the game, quarterback [51]Kirk Cousins
   [icon-article-link.gif] found Jackson for a first down on 2nd and 9
   when Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins came flying in late and delivered a
   blow towards Jackson’s injured left shoulder.

   Jackson retaliated by shoving Jenkins, and the Eagles’ Nate Allen
   shoved Jackson right back, earning a personal foul penalty in the
   process — and boos from the Lincoln Financial Field crowd.

   Jackson said the short scrum was just “the game of football.”

   “Like I said, it’s high energy and guys are doing anything and
   everything to try to knock you out of the game or to make a boneheaded
   play, but that’s the give and take of football,” Jackson said. “But it
   was nothing too big. I actually created a penalty, so I guess I won
   that one.”

   Jackson’s biggest play of the day came late in the third quarter with
   the Redskins trailing 27-20. On 1st and 10 from the Washington 19-yard
   line, Cousins — on play action — found Jackson deep, who caught the
   ball around the Eagles’ 25-yard line, broke an attempted tackle by
   cornerback Cary Williams, and took it the rest of the way for the
   81-yard touchdown that, after the extra point, tied the game at 27.

   While in the end zone, Jackson made sure to flap his wings for the
   69,596 in attendance.

   “I’m just out there playing the game with a lot of energy and a lot of
   excitement,” he said. “That’s something I’ve always done. I just try to
   do the best to support my team with energy.”

   Jackson’s performance was the 21st 100-yard receiving game of his
   career, and first with the Redskins.

   Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said he was happy with the way Jackson
   competed, despite playing with a sore shoulder.

   “I’m proud of the way he played,” Gruden said. “I’m proud that he came
   out here and competed – despite being very sore – and put together a
   good game.”

   Jackson said he’s looking forward to his next chance to play against
   his former team, which is Dec. 20 at FedExField.

   “We will get another game against them down the road,” he said.
