Citizens Financial Jumps After A Lackluster Start

   [44]Comment Now
   [45]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   It’s the biggest bank IPO since the financial crisis, but investors
   seem to have used up all their enthusiasm for Alibaba’s [46]market
   debut last week: Citizens Financial Group, a spinoff from the Royal
   Bank of Scotland, priced below its expected range and failed to wow
   with its performance in its first hour on the market. The good news is
   that the stock seems to be revving up as Wednesday trading continues —
   the stock is currently up 6% and seemingly climbing in afternoon
   trading.

   Shares of Citizens, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
   under the ticker “CFG,” started trading shortly after 10am ET on
   Wednesday, opening right around their list price and quickly turning
   into negative territory. As the trading day continued, however,
   investors seemed to warm to the stock, sending it for a 6% jump in
   afternoon trading.

   Citizens and RBS announced late Tuesday that shares of Citizens priced
   at $21.50, below the $23 to $25 per-share range that RBS provided
   earlier in the month. This price means that Citizens raised a little
   more than $3 billion in its IPO, just under the $3.5 billion RBS was
   aiming for but valuing the 186-year-old Rhode Island-based bank at $12
   billion.

   The IPO is also a relative dud compared to the hoopla surrounding the
   Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba, which debuted on Friday after raising
   more money than any other IPO in U.S. history — $21.8 billion — and
   eventually closing with a 38% premium to its $68 per-share offering
   price. If Citizens’ first hour on the market is any indication, it is
   unlikely to reach such levels. Shares were trading around $22.18 close
   to 11:00 am ET, 68 cents higher than their offering price.

   RBS first announced its intentions to divest subsidiary Citizens in
   2013; the Scottish bank, which is 80% owned by the British government,
   is on the hunt for capital. As RBS CEO Ross McEwan said earlier in the
   year, “The divestment of Citizens is a key component of our plan to
   continue to strengthen RBS’s capital position.  The achievement of our
   capital plan will allow us to focus fully on the needs of our
   customers.”

   Citizens is offering 140 million shares in this IPO, a figure that
   marks a 25% divestiture from RBS. The Scottish bank has previously said
   that it intends to have fully divested Citizens by the end of 2016.

   Despite the lack of the wow-factor around its subsidiary, RBS is
   trading in positive territory in Wednesday trading; shares of the
   Scottish bank are currently up about 1%.
