   When Sue Austin got a power chair 16 years ago, she felt a tremendous
   sense of freedom — yet others looked at her as though she had lost
   something. In her art, she aims to convey the spirit of wonder she
   feels wheeling through the world. Includes thrilling footage of an
   underwater wheelchair that lets her explore ocean beds, drifting
   through schools of fish, floating free in 360 degrees. (Filmed at
   TEDxWomen.)
