   "Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're
   finished." Dan Gilbert shares recent research on a phenomenon he calls
   the "end of history illusion," where we somehow imagine that the person
   we are right now is the person we'll be for the rest of time. Hint:
   that's not the case.

   [85]Dan Gilbert
   Psychologist; happiness expert
   Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says our beliefs about what will make
   us happy are often wrong — a premise he supports with intriguing
   research, and explains in his accessible and unexpectedly funny book,
   Stumbling on Happiness. [86]Full bio
