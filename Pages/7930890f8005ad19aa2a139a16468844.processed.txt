       [45]Martin Seligman [46]The new era of positive psychology
       Martin Seligman talks about psychology — as a field of study and as
       it works one-on-one with each patient and each practitioner. As it
       moves beyond a focus on disease, what can modern psychology help us
       to become?
       “From the father of positive psychology, and the former president
       of the APA.”

       [50]Angela Lee Duckworth [51]The key to success? Grit
       Leaving a high-flying job in consulting, Angela Lee Duckworth took
       a job teaching math to seventh graders in a New York public school.
       She quickly realized that IQ wasn’t the only thing separating the
       successful students from those who struggled. Here, she explains
       her theory of “grit” as a predictor of success.
       “A good talk on one of the most important components of positive
       business: not getting knocked down by setbacks.”

       [55]Neil Pasricha [56]The 3 A's of awesome
       Neil Pasricha's blog 1000 Awesome Things savors life's simple
       pleasures, from free refills to clean sheets. In this heartfelt
       talk, he reveals the 3 secrets (all starting with A) to leading a
       life that's truly awesome. (Filmed at TEDxToronto.)
       “A talk on gratitude, from a popular blogger — and an employee at
       Walmart.”

       [60]Simon Sinek [61]How great leaders inspire action
       Simon Sinek has a simple but powerful model for inspirational
       leadership all starting with a golden circle and the question
       "Why?" His examples include Apple, Martin Luther King, and the
       Wright brothers ... (Filmed at TEDxPugetSound.)
       “A talk that has resonated with millions, about how to create
       positive leadership.”

       [65]Dan Pink [66]The puzzle of motivation
       Career analyst Dan Pink examines the puzzle of motivation, starting
       with a fact that social scientists know but most managers don't:
       Traditional rewards aren't always as effective as we think. Listen
       for illuminating stories — and maybe, a way forward.
       “From a great modern thinker, a talk on smarter ways to create
       positive businesses.”

       [70]Barry Schwartz [71]The paradox of choice
       Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western
       societies: freedom of choice. In Schwartz's estimation, choice has
       made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more
       dissatisfied.
       “From another original architects of positive psychology research.”

       [75]Brené Brown [76]The power of vulnerability
       Brené Brown studies human connection — our ability to empathize,
       belong, love. In a poignant, funny talk, she shares a deep insight
       from her research, one that sent her on a personal quest to know
       herself as well as to understand humanity. A talk to share.
       “From a shame researcher, a culture-shifting talk.”

       [80]Susan Cain [81]The power of introverts
       In a culture where being social and outgoing are prized above all
       else, it can be difficult, even shameful, to be an introvert. But,
       as Susan Cain argues in this passionate talk, introverts bring
       extraordinary talents and abilities to the world, and should be
       encouraged and celebrated.
       “An interesting look at why we need personality diversity.”
