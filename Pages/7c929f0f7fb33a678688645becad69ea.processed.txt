   I’m a staff writer at Forbes covering real estate: from ultra-luxury
   homes to foreclosures to the people making the deals happen. Until
   recently, I was a member of our Forbes wealth team, crunching numbers
   for our Forbes 400 and World’s Billionaires lists. Before that I
   investigated a former Hell’s Angel for the City Pages of Minneapolis,
   trekked to the U.S.-Mexico border with the Minutemen for the Orange
   County Register, and exposed Michael Jackson’s property tax problems
   for the Santa Maria Times. A born and bred Westerner with strong ties
   in Minnesota, I love calling NYC home. Twitter: erin_carlyle. Got tips?

Sales Of New Homes Jump 18% In August, And July Better Than Initially Thought

   [44]Comment Now
   [45]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Sales of newly-constructed single-family [46]homes jumped 18% in
   August, hitting their highest sales pace since April 2008 and giving
   credence to the rising good mood among home builders.

   The sales estimates, released by Commerce Wednesday, provide hard data
   aligning with developer confidence in the housing market, which is at
   its [47]highest level since November 2005, the National Association of
   Homebuilders/[48]Wells Fargo [49]Wells Fargo reports. The last time
   newly-built homes sold this fast was in May 2008, when the annualized,
   seasonally-adjusted sales pace stood at 504,000, the same level as
   during last month.

   Wednesday’s release included a revision of prior months’ numbers,
   revealing that sales slowed only for one month (June) before bouncing
   back in July and surging quite dramatically in August. (Preliminary
   numbers showed sales at an annual pace of 412,000 in July, compared
   with a 427,000 revised annual pace.)

   New home sales numbers (annualized, seasonally adjusted):
   August 2014: 504,000
   July 2014: 427,000 (revised from 412,000)
   June 2014: 419,000 (revised)
   May 2014: 458,000 (revised)
   April 2014: 413,000 (revised)

   Sales of new homes represent only about one-tenth of the housing
   market, and are revised frequently (three times), making them a
   less-reliable measure of the market. By contrast, the steadier
   Existing-Home sales reports from the National Association of Realtors
   track the bulk of the market, previously-owned homes. On Monday the
   latest report showed existing-home sales slowing by 1.8% after four
   straight months of increases. Sales were down 5.3% from a year earlier,
   when the pace stood at 5.33 million. Still, August sales stood at the
   second-highest pace of 2014. (July’s sales numbers, still the highest
   of the year, were revised slightly downward to an annualized pace of
   5.14 million.)

   Monday’s existing home sales report also shows a decline in distressed
   sales (foreclosures and short sales), and investors exiting the market.
   Also, fewer buyers are purchasing homes with all cash. Both factors are
   helping normalize the housing market for regular buyers.

   For years, new home sales and previously-owned tracked one another
   fairly closely, but during the recession, as more people purchased
   distressed homes, sales of new homes fell. Economist Bill McBride of
   the [50]CalculatedRisk blog calls the gap between new and existing home
   sales the [51]“distressing gap.” Now, McBride writes, [52]he is
   expecting that gap to close:

     Another way to look at this is a ratio of existing to new home
     sales. This ratio was fairly stable from 1994 through 2006, and then
     the flood of distressed sales kept the number of existing home sales
     elevated and depressed new home sales. (Note: This ratio was fairly
     stable back to the early ’70s, but I only have annual data for the
     earlier years).

   The median sales price of a home sold in August was $275,600; the
   average sales price was $347,900. At the end of August inventory stood
   at 203,000, a 4.8-month supply at the current sales pace, according to
   the Commerce estimates.

   Year-over-year, sales of new homes were up 33% in August, compared to
   the prior year. But as McBride points out, sales dropped dramatically
   during Q3 2013 as mortgage rates increased.
