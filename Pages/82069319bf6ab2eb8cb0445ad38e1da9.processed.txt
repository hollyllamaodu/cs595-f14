Fight Against Climate Change Seen Driving Economic Growth

   The report found that about $90 trillion will be invested in city
   infrastructure over the next 15 years.

   Government and industry leaders need not choose between fighting
   climate change or growing the world’s economy. They can do both,
   according to a new study.

   Countries can expand their economies through emissions reductions in
   cities, land use and energy, according to a report released today by
   the Global Commission on the Economy & Climate, a panel set up by seven
   nations including the U.K. to advise on the best ways to tackle global
   warming.

   The report, which found that about $90 trillion will be invested in
   city infrastructure over the next 15 years, comes a week before world
   leaders head to New York for a climate summit hosted by United Nations
   Secretary General [59]Ban Ki-moon.

   [60]A Global Push to Save the Planet

   “The report sends a clear message to government and private sector
   leaders: we can improve the economy and tackle climate change at the
   same time,” former President of Mexico [61]Felipe Calderon, the
   commission chairman, said in an e-mailed statement.

   Building better-connected cities relying on mass public transportation
   may save more than $3 trillion in investment costs over the next 15
   years and would improve economic performance and quality of life,
   according to the report.

   “Climate protection has become a growth engine,” Barbara Hendricks,
   Germany’s environment minister, said today in an e-mailed statement.
   The world needs a shift away from coal to renewables, she said.

   Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, is seeking to replace nuclear
   reactors with renewables.

‘Severe Risks’

   Restoring 12 percent of the world’s degraded lands can feed 200 million
   people and raise farmers’ income by $40 billion a year, today’s report
   said. Governments should also triple research and development in
   low-carbon technologies to at least 0.1 percent of gross domestic
   product and phase out $600 billion of fossil fuel subsidies, it said.

   “If we choose low-carbon investment we can generate strong,
   high-quality growth –- not just in the future, but now,” said
   [62]Nicholas Stern, the commission’s co-chairman. “But if we continue
   down the high-carbon route, climate change will bring severe risks to
   long-term prosperity.”

   The research was carried out by economic and policy groups including
   the World Resources Institute and the London School of Economics and
   Political Science, with contributions from the OECD, the World Bank,
   International Monetary Fund and the International Energy Agency.
