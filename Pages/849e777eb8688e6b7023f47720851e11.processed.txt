5 Giant Myths Of Retirement Planning

   By Marc S. Freedman, [46]Next Avenue Contributor

   (This article was adapted from [47]Retiring for the GENIUS by Marc S.
   Freedman.)

   Some myths become legend, and once they reach that level of status,
   it’s tough to shake them from their perch. The world of [48]retirement
   planning is no different. These are five myths that still exist in
   retirement planning:

   1. Don’t touch the principal — live off the interest. It’s been more
   than two decades since retirees could comfortably consider retiring off
   the interest they earned at the bank.

   Today, you need to take a more sophisticated look at your overall
   financial life. If not, you’ll find yourself living a life of scarcity
   when your retirement life could be filled with abundance.

   (MORE: [49]Biggest 401(k) Mistakes People Make)

   Consider taking a total-return approach as a mechanism for creating an
   income stream. Essentially, that means building an investment portfolio
   that leaves roughly 5 to 8% of your investable assets in cash. Once a
   month, you have a check for a predetermined amount electronically
   withdrawn from the cash account and deposited into your checking
   account. As the cash portion of your portfolio depletes to 3 to 5% of
   the value, you rebalance the portfolio and replenish the cash account.

   2. The more a financial plan weighs, the more valuable it is. When my
   father first started in the [50]financial planning business, he joked
   that financial planning was delivered by the pound. Financial
   institutions would battle over who had the most attractive, heaviest,
   most premium leather binder to provide a client. But in truth, most
   pages were boilerplate filler.

   Today’s financial plans are living documents. Generally, they are
   introduced with a three- to five-page executive summary that highlights
   your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The report is
   supplemented with eight to 12 pages of high-level analysis and reports.
   The last page features an “action plan” that lists steps you should
   consider taking to better position yourself for retirement success.

   All this data is then made available through a cloud-based software
   system where you (and, if necessary, your adviser) can monitor the
   progress of your plan and keep you on track.

   3. My life is simple and I have a will — that’s all I need. I’m always
   amazed by how unprepared people are when a loved one (especially a
   spouse or parent) passes away. Without proper planning, the days
   following a death can be disastrous and not the way the deceased had
   planned.

   No, I’m not talking about the division of assets and who inherits which
   jewelry. It starts with someone, other than the deceased, knowing
   [51]where instructions are pertaining to the funeral, cemetery and
   final wishes.

   (MORE: [52]Make That Scary, Essential Money List)

   Many people elect to keep end-of-life instructions in a safe deposit
   box. Yet if you haven’t given anybody instructions on where to find the
   key and/or who has authority to open the box, your wishes may not be
   fulfilled.

   No matter how simple a life you lead, or how basic you’d like your
   funeral to be, it’s important that your instructions be clearly noted
   and that someone knows where those notes exist. Finally, I recommend
   having your personally written wishes notarized.

   4. A surviving spouse will honor the way the deceased spouse managed
   money. With you gone, your spouse’s life will change. For a short time,
   your spouse may wonder, “What would Irving do?” or “How did Sylvia
   handle all the bills?” but soon that will fade. A surviving spouse’s
   life adapts and changes to the new environment.
   What’s even scarier is the thought that your [53]spouse never learned
   how to handle the checkbook, pay bills, purchase a car, upgrade cell
   phone plans, make decisions on extended warranties or plan a vacation.

   Make certain that you are both familiar with day-to-day money
   management skills, or build a relationship with someone to serve as a
   trusted adviser for the surviving spouse who you fell will place your
   interests first.

   5. When I retire, I need to dramatically shift my investment portfolio
   away from stocks and into bonds. You’ve probably heard the myth:
   “Invest your age in bonds and the rest in stocks.” The truth is,
   everyone’s personal financial situation is unique. You may need to
   increase your stock allocation in retirement, especially if the bulk of
   your retirement income comes from non-inflation-protected pensions.

   More importantly, you should view your overall investment allocation by
   including all your investable assets. This might include money in the
   bank, annuities, the cash value of life insurance, personal
   investments, retirement accounts — and, yes, even the present value of
   your pension and Social Security.

   With all this data, now you can build an asset allocation that truly
   reflects your retirement income needs.
