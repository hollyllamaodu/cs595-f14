   How much do you know about the world? Hans Rosling, with his famous
   charts of global population, health and income data (and an
   extra-extra-long pointer), demonstrates that you have a high
   statistical chance of being quite wrong about what you think you know.
   Play along with his audience quiz — then, from Hans’ son Ola, learn 4
   ways to quickly get less ignorant.
