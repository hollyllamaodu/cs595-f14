   Microsoft on Monday confirmed that it will acquire the studio that
   created the hit "sandbox" game Minecraft for $2.5 billion, a move that
   could help bolster the company's Xbox and mobile ambitions.

   Microsoft said the deal will close by the end of this year.

   "Minecraft is more than a great game franchise," said Microsoft CEO
   Satya Nadella. "It is an open-world platform, driven by a vibrant
   community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for
   that community and for Microsoft."

   Launched in 2009 for PCs, Minecraft is an open-world game where players
   roam a simple landscape with forests and beaches, breaking apart the
   environment and building new objects like a digital Lego set.

   It has surged in popularity over the past five years. Microsoft says
   the game has topped 100 million downloads. Although it has been
   available on Apple's iOS devices for nearly three years, it is
   currently the second most popular paid app for iPhone. Retail versions
   of the video game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 were the third
   best-selling titles in the U.S. last month, according to NPD Group.

   'Minecraft' deal aids Microsoft beyond Xbox

   "The functionality in what you can actually build is off the charts,"
   says FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. The game has spawned the
   creation of incredible landscapes, including homages to [78]Game of
   Thronesand The Hunger Games.

   "The Minecraft players have taken the game and turned it into something
   that surpassed all of our expectations," Mojang CEO Carl Manneh said.
   "The acquisition by Microsoft brings a new chapter to the incredible
   story."

   Microsoft says Minecraft will remain available on all current
   platforms, including PlayStation, a rival to the company's Xbox brand.

   In a [79]separate statement, Minecraft creator Markus "Notch" Persson
   revealed he will leave Mojang when the deal is complete.

   "Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are
   too many of you, and I can't be responsible for something this big,"
   said Persson. "In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much
   bigger sense, it's belonged to all of you for a long time, and that
   will never change."

   The Minecraft deal bolsters support from Nadella for the company's Xbox
   brand, which had been rumored as a potential sales piece. However,
   [80]in a memo sent to employees in July, Nadella said the company will
   "continue to grow and innovate" the brand.

   But the Minecraft deal stretches beyond games. Snagging one of the
   video game industry's hottest properties should help Microsoft grow its
   Windows Phone line, which sits a distant third from giants Apple iOS
   and Google Android.

   "Minecraft strengthens Microsoft's hand in the battle with Google,
   Apple and Amazon," says IDC analyst Al Hilwa. "In the battle for mobile
   dominance or relevance, platform owners have to tussle with each other,
   trading and bartering mutual support for popular consumer services
   across their mobile platforms. Minecraft is a solid business with
   intense user loyalty."
