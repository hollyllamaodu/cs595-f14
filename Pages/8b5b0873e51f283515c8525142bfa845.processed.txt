    President Obama put it this way: "Cynicism is a choice—and hope is a
       better choice."

       On Tuesday, members of Congress return to Washington from summer
       recess—and there's a lot of work waiting for them.
       It's easy to get discouraged about our chances of making progress.
       After all, this has been the least productive Congress in modern
       history, thanks to some extreme voices in the House who seek
       gridlock.
       Today, in spite of that, I'm asking you not to be cynical—because
       that only makes those voices stronger. They're counting on
       passionate Americans tuning out and giving up at times like this.
       We refuse to let that cynicism win out—[52]stand up with me today
       and send a message to those leaders in Congress that we expect them
       to get to work for the American people, and we're not going away.
       [53]Post by [54]Barack Obama.
       The truth is there's only one way that these folks get away with
       nonsense like wasteful lawsuits against the President, failing to
       lift a finger to fix our broken immigration system, or threatening
       to shut down the government AGAIN.
       They get away with it because too many people have come to expect
       nothing better from Washington.
       That cynicism gives the other side a pass they don't deserve. I
       refuse to let it be a foregone conclusion that leaders in Congress
       can't come together to get something done for the American people.
       These people work for us. We should be frustrated. We should be
       outraged. And we should speak up. President Obama put it this way:
       "Cynicism is a choice—and hope is a better choice."
       [55]Add your name today and say you refuse to be cynical.
