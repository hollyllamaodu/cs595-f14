Fortune 500 companies take center stage at U.N. climate summit

   A few years back at a United Nations climate talks in Bali, business
   executives hunkered down at a nearby hotel and talked mostly how they
   could make money off the problem. Outside, angry protesters accused
   carbon traders of trying to get rich off the poor.

   Fast forward to Tuesday, when many Fortune 500 CEOs will get a ringside
   seat at [28]the U.N. climate summit in New York. About 125 presidents
   and prime ministers are expected at the one-day event featuring world
   leaders laying out their visions for combating global warming. Then,
   executives from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell, McDonalds [29]MCD ,
   Unilever [30]UN and Ikea will get lunch with Secretary-General Ban
   Ki-moon to talk further about climate change.

   “I think it’s a very, very positive sign,” Todd Stern, the State
   Department’s chief climate negotiator, told reporters last week.

   “Business is increasingly focused on trying to, in some cases, be part
   of the clean energy revolution that is increasingly going on around the
   world and increasingly gathering force,” he said. “It’s a very, very
   positive sign that CEOs are recognizing this issue as something that
   they either want to deal with in a very effective — in a way that’s
   good for business, or have to deal with because it’s going to affect
   their business whether they like it or not.”

   Many executives are expected to detail actions their companies are
   taking to tackle climate change while about 30 CEOs will agree to set
   an internal price on carbon and advocate more broadly for carbon
   pricing which the World Bank and others contend can inspire countries
   to regulate emissions and drive technology innovation.

   While the summit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs, the day
   will not be short of star power.

   President Obama will come out in support of a new climate deal. Former
   Vice President Al Gore will join the new U.N. representative on climate
   change Leonardo DiCaprio in an effort to inspire leaders to commit to
   forging a legally binding international agreement by December 2015 in
   Paris. It would call for countries to set emissions targets by 2020 and
   provide tens of billions of dollars in financing to help poor countries
   adapt to climate change and transition away from fossil fuels.

   The meeting comes in the wake of a flurry of reports from business
   groups, the United Nations and the White House demonstrating the
   increasing cost of inaction and the benefits of embracing a greener
   future. [31]A report out last week found that tackling emission doesn’t
   have to slow the global economy, while [32]another out earlier this
   summer from the White House warned that failing to act could cost
   upwards of $150 billion a year ad go up 40% for each decade the world
   fails to act.

   At the same time, Fortune 500 executives have been falling over another
   to announce renewable targets, commitments to cut their own emissions
   and calling out laggards for opposing a new climate deal.

   “In Copenhagen, businesses were left waiting at the altar for
   governments to solve the problem,” Lou Leonard, WWF’s vice president of
   climate change, said of the failed 2009 talks.

   “After that experience, many in the private sector decided to move
   forward on their own climate action plans, without waiting for
   government,” he said. “In the US, key businesses like Walmart [33]WMT ,
   Mars and Proctor & Gamble [34]PG , are helping create a revolution in
   the power sector by switching to 100% renewable energy.”

   On Monday at the opening of week of climate related activities, the
   World Bank announced that 1,000 companies were joining 73 countries and
   11 regions to come out in favor of putting a price on carbon — either
   through a tax or through a cap and trade system. Others, like Hewlett
   Packard, announced plans to reduce emissions intensity of its product
   portfolio by 40 percent from 2010 levels by 2020 while Apple’s CEO Tim
   Cook called for greater transparency among businesses on climate change
   and the environment.

   “Companies have to communicate to consumers about what they are selling
   and they have to do it in a way that incorporate the whole of their
   footprint not just one piece of it that they are looking good,”
   [35]Apple CEO Tim Cook said. “If you have enough companies that begin
   to do this, then consumers will vote with their dollars.”

   Many business groups said the increased activity from businesses is
   more than idle chatter. They are moving in the right direction and just
   need a stronger policy signal from governments and the United Nations
   to go even further.

   Ceres, the Boston-based organization that promotes sustainable
   practices, said 43% of Fortune 500 companies now have clean energy
   targets and that the number of institutional investors committed to
   tackling climate change has grown from 10 in 2003 to 110 in 2013
   representing $13 trillion in assets.

   “Many in the business community, and in unprecedented numbers at this
   point, are eager for climate action,” said Ceres President Mindy
   Lubber, who is projecting that businesses will reduce their emissions
   by 25%, improve energy efficiency of operations by 50%, source 30% from
   renewable sources and reduce electricity demand by 15% by 2020.

   “From unlikely candidates like General Motors and Nike and General
   Mills to Apple, businesses are seeing first hand the devastating impact
   of climate change and realize this is not good for the planet or the
   economy,” she said. “They do not like what they see. They want stronger
   and clearer signals, stronger climate policies in Washington and around
   the world. They want an international treaty in Paris in 2015.”

   Business, according to U.N. Climate Chief Christiana Figueres, are also
   driving a booming clean energy sector which aims to shift the world’s
   economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels. Global investment in
   clean technologies is now up to $300 billion a year and the low carbon
   economy is now worth $4 trillion globally and is growing at 4% a year.

   “The cost of solar energy has come down 80% since 2008. That doesn’t
   happen just by happenstance. That happens because there are companies
   out there and governments deciding to inject research and development
   funding into this industry to bring down the cost of production,”
   Figueres said. “Wind very similar has come down 50% in cost and
   increased 40% in efficiency …It’s because of a very clear corporate
   decision that this is the future.”

   But there is much more the business community can do and many leading
   executives who remain unconvinced urgent action is needed. The likes of
   Exxon and BP won’t be at Tuesday’s summit and the U.S. Chamber of
   Commerce, the world’s largest business lobby, is leading the opposition
   against Obama’s Clean Power Plan which calls for a 30% reduction in
   emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels. They fear the plan will damage the
   economy but do little for the environment.

   Environmental groups also will be looking Tuesday to see if more
   companies demonstrate they are making emissions cuts in line with the
   science and also ensuring that they are “not associating” themselves
   with companies that are harming the planet.

   “To date, we only found that 30% of companies are aligning their
   lobbying with their corporate social responsibility commitments,”
   Jennifer Morgan, the director of the World Resources Institute’s
   climate and energy program. “So look and listen for companies like
   Unilever which recently left (pro-business group) Business Europe to
   see if they are ensuring consistently between company climate change
   positions and that of various business associations.”
