Where Have All The Grownups Gone? Why 'Adulthood' As We Know It Is Dead

   [45]Comment Now

   [47]Would you rather buy Super Bowl tickets or a Vitamix blender? Your
   answer may depend on your age . Recent survey research from Eventbrite
   [48]found that [49]Millenials are increasingly prioritizing spending on
   events and ephemeral experiences over tangible assets . Is this refusal
   to delay gratification yet another sign of a generation that refuses to
   grow up?

   We have twentysomethings living at home, [50]holding off on marriage
   and families, [51]relying on their parents for financial handouts and
   [52]job interview support, [53]eschewing unfulfilling jobs, favoring
   public transit over cars and [54]not showing much interest in building
   up their credit scores. In short, they’re shrugging off many of the
   markers that have traditionally defined American adulthood.  In some
   cases, Millennial lifestyle choices are constrained by monetary
   realities (student loan repayments vs. a new Subaru is no contest),
   but, more broadly, there’s an attitudinal sea change evident here.
   After all, the idea of a “dream job” [55]would seem downright ludicrous
   to our grandparents.


   English: Doesn't this playground look like so ...

   English: Doesn’t this playground look like so much fun? (Photo credit:
   Wikipedia)

   This disinclination to grow up is reinforced by popular culture and
   technology. We devour YA novels and superhero movies. We have an entire
   [56]subculture of grown men who are ardent fans of cartoon ponies meant
   for little girls. We eagerly buy tickets to see boy band reunion tours
   where the “boys” are now mostly married dads pushing 40, who in decades
   past, would be relegated to playing state fairs and casinos. In our
   nostalgia-driven culture, they still have currency. We [57]can even pay
   big bucks to regress back to the days when we penned Mom and Dad
   letters from Camp Sleepy Pines, except in this new iteration, craft
   time refers to craft beer and campers are as likely to arrive with
   condoms as they are bug spray. Welcome to a world in which all you ever
   need outgrow is clothing.

   The mores of high school persist into adulthood via our engagement with
   social media. The [58]self esteem effects of comparing ourselves to
   others on Facebook or Instagram is as real as making those same “Is her
   life better than mine?” comparisons in homeroom. Online, we flout the
   norms of hierarchy and formality. [59]Your professor friends you on
   Facebook. You can follow your boss’s Twitter. We’re all 15 again. Taken
   to a deceitful and sad extreme, we end up with a [60]story like that of
   Charity Johnson, who has spent her adult life to date pretending to be
   a teen and using Facebook to seek out a string of mother figures to
   rescue her.

   A. O. Scott [61]recently wrote of the death of adulthood in popular
   culture and how we’re seeing entertainment that glorifies permanent
   adolescence. Patriarchs of film and television have been replaced by
   man children and women whose first visions of aspirational adulthood
   came from Sex And The City.

   “I do feel the loss of something here, but bemoaning the general
   immaturity of contemporary culture would be as obtuse as declaring it
   the coolest thing ever. A crisis of authority is not for the faint of
   heart. It can be scary and weird and ambiguous. But it can be a lot of
   fun, too. The best and most authentic cultural products of our time
   manage to be all of those things. They imagine a world where no one is
   in charge and no one necessarily knows what’s going on, where
   identities are in perpetual flux. Mothers and fathers act like
   teenagers; little children are wise beyond their years. Girls light out
   for the territory and boys cloister themselves in secret gardens. We
   have more stories, pictures and arguments than we know what to do with,
   and each one of them presses on our attention with a claim of
   uniqueness, a demand to be recognized as special. The world is our
   playground, without a dad or a mom in sight,” he writes.

   While Scott offers mixed praise for a Peter Pan effect in entertainment
   and Laurence Steinberg [62]muses that delaying adulthood could mean
   increased brain plasticity, what is the downside of living in a world
   where we’re no longer required to put away childish things? Certainly,
   it’s a trend that has the auto and housing industries on edge, but what
   about the effects of arrested development on the individual? [63]How
   healthy is it for 30 year-olds to be going to summer camp?

   For author [64]Anneli Rufus, a retreat to the past is less about
   embracing a mindset that rejects traditional maturation into rigid
   roles and more about being mired in fear of the present or future and
   unable to catch up to either. Protracted adolescence is an anxious
   state in which to live. As she writes in Stuck: Why We Can’t (or Won’t)
   Move On:

   “We are stuck in the past, not usually by choice, but because, like dud
   popcorn kernels or bonsai trees, we failed to grow. The ones who were
   supposed to show us how did not. They did not know or were not there.
   Portals inscribed with mystical initiation signs gleamed in the
   moonlight through which we were meant to walk, but no: We wandered back
   the other way or balked. Or something happened way back when and bang.
   The end.”

   She’s not writing exclusively about young adults, but she very well
   could be.

   Despite hand-wringing to the contrary, today’s youth [65]aren’t
   significantly more narcissist than previous generations, but the time
   horizon during which they are free to focus on themselves does extend
   far longer. Without mortgage payments or midnight feedings, they’re
   able to devote their attention and income to self-improvement and self
   indulgence almost exclusively, which is why Eventbrite’s findings
   aren’t particularly surprising. Instead of the traditional secular
   Rumspringa-like interregnum between being parented and being a parent
   that coincided with the college years, that period of reduced
   responsibility has been stretching into the late 20s and early 30s. And
   we’re largely okay with that. Suddenly, Girls’ Hannah all but demanding
   her parents continue to support her post-college literary ambitions
   seems gauche but unsurprising and 13 Going On 30 feels more like a
   documentary than a cute romcom.

   It’s worth asking ourselves when time finally comes for Millennials to
   assume the mantle of adulthood, whether by biological imperative or
   economic necessity (Boomer parents are not immortal), how ready will
   they really be?

       “Millennials are increasing(ly) prioritizing spending on events and
       ephemeral experiences over tangible assets. Is this refusal to
       delay gratification yet another sign of a generation that refuses
       to grow up?” NO. Is it being suggested that delayed gratification
       of experiences is “good” while delaying gratification of purchasing
       is “bad”, regardless of whether it is the responsible thing to do?
       Is collecting assets that you can’t afford the “adult” thing to do?
       Elders could learn from cautious young adults. The “experiences”
       being endured by today’s young adults might be the sobering reality
       of trying to enjoy life while living within your means. Considering
       that the US debt is over 17 TRILLION dollars with 10,000 baby
       boomers retiring every day, that is a lesson in “adulthood” that
       Elder’s seemed to miss.

       According to social scientists, “childish” Millennials are,
       compared to the three previous generations, less violent, do fewer
       drugs, are more likely support inclusive and diverse social
       policies, and more likely to value experiences, family and friends
       above the pursuit of material gain.
       If this is what the death of “adulthood” brings us, I say lets
       bring a keg to the funeral.

       Heh. I’m reminded of an Economist piece bemoaning the fact that
       Millennials were too “boring” and not making enough boneheaded
       decisions.

       There have been many studies indicating that Millennials are
       actually more fiscally conservative than both Gen X and Baby
       Boomers. Moreover, they have been able to organized and sustaining
       a sharing economy in the midst of our country’s financial crisis.
       Moreover, recent studies also show that Millennial are also most
       likely to contribute to philanthropy, including both contributions
       to institutions and more personally as we see in movements like
       ‘pay-it-forward.’ It is normal for an older generation to dismiss a
       younger one. However, it is unwise and highly unprofitable to get
       your analysis wrong about any people group. Millennial may tend to
       suffer from a certain amount of ignorance in many areas, but it is
       incorrect to pin it on a lack of discipline or their inability to
       delay gratification.
