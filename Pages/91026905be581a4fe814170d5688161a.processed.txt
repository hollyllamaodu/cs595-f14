Rocket Internet Valued At More Than $8 Billion After Incubator Prices Shares

   Rocket Internet, the Berlin-based startup incubator that has launched
   startups from Brazil to India, set the price range for its initial
   public offering on Tuesday, which could value the company as high as
   $8.4 billion (6.5 billion Euros.)

   Rocket could sell as many as 37.9 million shares, or 24% of the
   company, between the range of $46.50 (35.50 Euros) to $56.40 (42.50
   euros) per share. Assuming that Rocket offloads all of those shares,
   which includes an over-allotment or “greenshoe” option, the company and
   selling shareholders could raise up to $2.1 billion (1.6 billion euros)
   if they sell at the high point of the predicted range.

   That amount is far more than the $970 million (750 million euros) the
   company initially said it would raise when it announced its
   offering [48]earlier this month. Rocket’s pricing comes in lockstep
   with German fashion retailer Zalando, which set its [49]own IPO price
   range last week and plans to raise as much as $818 million (633 million
   Euros) in its Oct. 1 offering.

   “We have built a unique platform that has allowed us to take internet
   business models to over 100 countries today, bringing basic goods and
   services to our diverse customer base,” said 41-year-old Rocket CEO
   Oliver Samwer in a statement earlier this month. “Taking our company
   public is the next step in our journey to build the world’s leading
   internet platform outside of the United States and China.”

   Rocket Internet and Zalando’s public offerings mark a watershed moment
   for the German–and specifically Berlin–tech scene. The IPOs will be the
   two largest for the country’s technology sector since the 2000 listing
   of [50]Deutsche Telekom [51]Deutsche Telekom.

   Founded in 2007 by Marc, Oliver and Alexander Samwer, Rocket Internet
   was created to establish e-commerce and online retailing companies in
   places that the three brothers saw as underserved markets. Often
   mimicking the business models and designs of American companies, Rocket
   has established more than 75 firms around the globe including Zalando,
   which was built initially as a European model of American online shoe
   retailer, Zappos.

   Investors will value Rocket based on its stakes in the companies that
   it has launched as well as its potential to keep developing new
   e-commerce focused startups. In its IPO documents, the company
   described that it started several proven winners, though those that
   disclosed financial data did not show profits in 2013. Rocket-backed
   companies that recorded losses last year included Russian fashion
   online retailer Lamoda, which lost $51.5 million (40.1 million Euros);
   German online home furnishings site Westwing, which lost $82.2 million
   (64 million Euros); and Latin American e-commerce portal Linio, which
   lost $18.6 million (14.5 million Euros.)

   Prior to its IPO announcement, Rocket had been on a fundraising tear.
   Last month, the company [52]raised nearly $900 million in private
   capital from two investments made by the Philippines Long Distance
   Telephone company and Germany’s United Internet. The company also took
   the steps to restructure ownership stakes in some of its startups prior
   to an IPO.

   The build up to Rocket’s IPO has made its founders, the Samwer
   brothers, [53]into billionaires. Through their holding company, Global
   Founders, the brothers currently control 52.3% of the startup
   incubator, splitting that stake evenly. The Samwers also collectively
   own about 17% of Zalando. If Zalando and Rocket price their shares at
   the top of their respective ranges, FORBES estimates that each Samwer
   brother would be worth at least $1.8 billion.

   Rocket Internet noted that it already had commitments from investors to
   buy up to $749 million-worth (583 million Euros) of shares in its IPO
   from a group that included Baillie Gifford & Co. and [54]J.P. Morgan
   [55]J.P. Morgan. Existing investors have agreed not to sell their
   shares for at least a year following the offering, with the only
   exception being Global Founders’ potential sale to satisfy the
   greenshoe option.

   Rocket Internet will be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s entry
   standard under the ticker “RKET” and said it could start trading as
   early as Oct. 9. The entry standard is know for being more lax than the
   exchange’s prime standard and isn’t subject to the European Union’s
   regulations on reporting finances. Rocket said in a previous statement
   that it plans to make the move to the prime or general standard of the
   Frankfurt Stock Exchange in as early as 18 months.

   German bank Berenberg, [56]J.P. Morgan and [57]Morgan Stanley
   [58]Morgan Stanley will act as the lead underwriters on the
   offering. [59]Bank of America [60]Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
   [61]Citigroup [62]Citigroup and UBS Investment Bank will act as joint
   bookrunners.

       As most of the startups they backed are just clones of other
       companies born in Europe or in the U.S. this is the definitive
       proof that what really matters is execution, not being original and
       groundbreaking
