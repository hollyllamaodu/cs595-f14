How to Get Better Galaxy S5 Battery Life With Ultra Power Saving Mode

   These days smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S5 have huge screens,
   faster processors for apps and gaming, and continue to be packed full
   of features. One thing we constantly hear concerns about though, is how
   that all affects battery life.
   [INS: :INS]

   The brand new [22]Samsung Galaxy S5 has been available for less than a
   month, but we’re already getting a flood of questions from users and
   prospective buyers regarding some of the highly touted features on the
   new phone.

   When announced back in February on stage Samsung was happy to introduce
   a new feature called Ultra Power Saving mode, with the promise that it
   would make your smartphone last for days. Of course you won’t have a
   fully functioning device, but the feature could come in handy, not to
   mention save a life in case of an emergency. For those who do or don’t
   know about Ultra Power Saving mode on the Galaxy S5, read on to learn
   more, and how to activate it yourself.

             Read: [23]14 things every Galaxy S5 owner should do
    [24]How to Get Better Galaxy S5 Battery Life With Ultra Power Saving
                                    Mode

   Essentially what Ultra Power Saving mode offers is an experience that
   limits your smartphone to only offer the basics, but will leave you
   with a device that can potentially last for over 10 days with a single
   charge. The standby time and usage time will differ, but this could
   come in handy while camping, or many other scenarios.

   Ultra Power Saving mode puts the phone into a grey-scale black and
   white mode, and disables most features. However, users will still be
   able to use the device as a “smart” phone and along with calls, texts,
   and emails, you can also browse the web, and even Facebook for those
   social butterflies.

   Samsung claims even 5% battery life will last nearly 8 hours (or
   overnight) in standby if you’re using Ultra Power Saving mode. This is
   extremely useful for those nights you don’t have a charger, while
   camping, and especially in case of emergencies. Here’s a quick video
   for a visual explanation on what it offers, and how to enable it.

            IFRAME: [25]//www.youtube.com/embed/k1NOeeTcuXQ?rel=0

   [INS: :INS]

   As you can see the phone becomes a basic phone, but will still offer
   web browsing and a few other important aspects. Location, GPS, colors,
   and tons of other sensors and features are all disabled. Many users
   love everything the Galaxy S5 has to offer but if you don’t need them,
   or are in a bind, this Ultra Power Saving mode could really come in
   handy.

   So while the phone isn’t very useful, Samsung does provide a few
   important features to still be accessible, even though they’ll affect
   battery life. WiFi can still be enabled and accessed for a faster
   connection, Bluetooth is in options, and users can still control the
   brightness, volume, and ringtones. That’s about it though, as
   everything else gets disabled to keep your device powered on for days
   and days, rather than hours.

   While the video above should have explained everything perfectly clear,
   we’ll also run down exactly how to enable this yourself once again.
   Sliding down from the top of the screen with two fingers is a trick
   that brings you to quick settings, rather than the regular notification
   pulldown bar options. Simply select the “U. Power saving” icon and
   select “Ok” to enable this mode. It’s that easy, and only a few steps
   away.

   However, users can also head into the settings menu through regular
   means to enable Ultra Power Saving Mode. Pull down the notification bar
   and hit the gear-shaped icon near the top right. From here you’ll see a
   list of icons and settings. The lower right hand side should have a
   green battery icon labeled “Power Saving”.

    [26]How to Get Better Galaxy S5 Battery Life With Ultra Power Saving
                                    Mode

      Settings > Power Saving > Ultra Power Saving mode > Swipe to ON >
                                  select OK

   Once selected you’ll be given a popup confirming you’d like to switch
   to Power Saving Mode, which is appreciated considering it takes more
   than a few seconds for your device to make the switch. Once complete
   users will notice the grey-scale display, and all those popular
   features are gone. However, it’s all about preserving that battery
   life.

   Should You Use This?

   The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a beautiful 5.1-inch 1080p HD display, a
   fingerprint scanner inside the home button for enhanced security, an
   awesome 16 megapixel camera, and runs the latest version of Android.
   It’s one of the best Android devices and smartphones available in 2014,
   but none of that will work once this is enabled.

   Of course Ultra Power Saving mode isn’t something consumers will use on
   a daily basis, so whether or not buyers use this feature is entirely up
   to them. If you want better battery life during road trips, camping,
   late nights out, or in case of emergencies, Ultra Power Saving mode is
   the perfect solution. If you’re just looking for all around better
   battery life, without losing any features, perhaps an extended battery
   purchase is a better option.

   Ultra Power Saving mode certainly wasn’t designed to be used on a daily
   basis by users, but many will find it comes in handy during certain
   situations. Give it a try on your next vacation, you’ll be surprised
   just how long the Galaxy S5 can last on a single charge.
