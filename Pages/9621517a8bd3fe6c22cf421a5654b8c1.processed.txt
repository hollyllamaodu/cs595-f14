   Health care spending has, for decades, followed a consistent pattern.
   America pays more and more for health care — and gets less and less.

   Between 1990 and 2012, the insured rate in the United States [18]fell
   two percentage points, from 86.6 to 84.6 percent. If the insured rate
   had just held steady, six million more people would have been covered
   in 2012.

   While we were covering less people, we kept spending more on health
   care. National health spending, over that time period, [19]rose from 12
   percent of the economy in 1990 to 17.2 percent in 2012. Adjusted for
   inflation, health-care spending rose from $1.1 trillion to $2.8
   trillion over those 22 years.

   health spend more get less health spend more get less

   That's been the typical story of American health care: a lousy deal
   where we get less and spend more.

   But there's a growing body of evidence that this trend is changing;
   that we're starting to get a shockingly better deal in a way that has
   giant consequences for how America spends money. Call it the "get more,
   pay less" era.

The "get more, pay less" era of health care spending

   There are two big trends that, taken together, suggest we may be
   fundamentally different era of health care spending.

   The first is lots more people getting coverage. This is mostly
   Obamacare: the health care law is expected to expand insurance coverage
   to[20] 26 million people by 2024. In 2014 alone, most estimates suggest
   about [21]5 million people have gained health coverage through the law.
   The recovering economy is likely playing a supporting role, too, with
   those gaining jobs also gaining access to employer-sponsored coverage.

   The second big trend is in what we spend: actuaries expect that health
   care costs will grow slower over the next decade than they did in the
   1990s and 2000s.

   More specifically: health care costs grew, on average, 2 percent faster
   than the economy between 1990 and 2008. Health spending took over an
   ever-growing share of the economy. Workers [22]barely got raises;
   skyrocketing premiums ate up most of their additional wages.

   The next decade is now expected to be different. Actuaries at the
   Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services project health care costs to
   grow 1 percent faster than the rest of the economy between 2013 and
   2023.

   "We are seeing historic moderation in costs now over a considerable
   period of time," Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says.
   HIs group recently released data showing slow growth of
   employer-sponsored coverage. "It's absolutely true we're seeing that
   and any expert will tell you that."

   This is startling: over the next decade, forecasters think our health
   spending will grow at a slower rate, even as millions and millions of
   Americans gain access to health insurance. After two decades of
   spending more and getting less, we're entering an era of spending less
   and getting more. It's bizarro health spending world.

There are signs of this throughout the health care system

   One thing that's so striking about the "get more, pay less" trend is
   that it isn't limited to one particular insurance plan or program. It's
   starting to crop up in lots of new health care data, suggesting this
   change has become pervasive in the health care industry.

   Start with private health insurance: the Kaiser Family Foundation
   recently published[23] research finding the average price of
   Obamacare's benchmark will fall slightly in 2015. As my colleague Ezra
   Klein wrote recently, this just about unprecedented. "Falling is not a
   word that people associate with health-insurance premiums," he writes
   ."They tend to rise as regularly as the morning sun."

   Lower premiums make health care dollars stretch further: Obamacare
   shoppers will be able to buy the coverage they had last year at a
   slightly lower price. That's a big deal when you're talking about
   paying for a health insurance program meant to cover tens of millions
   of Americans.

   Increasingly narrow health insurance networks are another sign of "get
   more, pay less" era. Over the past few years — and especially under
   Obamacare —insurers have gravitated towards cheaper premium plans to
   offer access to a smaller number of doctors.

   narrow network graph

   These plans' more limited doctor choice can have a big impact on
   spending. [24]Research from economists Jon Gruber and Robin McKnight
   found that, in one example, switching enrollees to these plans cut
   overall spending by one third. And while patients had access to fewer
   hospitals, the hospitals that were in network were of equally good
   quality.

   Then there's the Medicare side of the equation, where there has been a
   unprecedented decline in per person spending. Margot Sanger-Katz at the
   Upshot has had two fantastic [25]posts on Medicare's cost slowdown. One
   of them points out the fact that, since 2010, per patient spending has
   grown slower than the rest of the economy. You can see that in this
   graph, which charts "excess cost growth" in Medicare (health wonk speak
   for cost growth above and beyond inflation). For the past few years,
   excess growth has been replaced by slower-than-the-economy growth.

   medicare excess cost growth

   ([26]The New York Times)

   As Sanger-Katz points out, there are two trends at play in Medicare.
   One is that younger baby boomers keep aging onto the program. They're
   younger than Medicare's really old patients, and typically less
   expensive to care for. That drives down per person spending for the
   whole population.

   But there's something else going on that looks to be a more permanent
   trend: Medicare patients are using less expensive care. They go to the
   doctor more, and the hospital less. You can see this in [27]new data
   from the Medicare Trustees' report, which shows per person spending on
   Medicare Part A (the program that covers inpatient care) falling over
   the past few years.

   medicare medicare

   Because of this shift away from hospital care, Medicare Part A now
   spends less money to cover more people. It paid $266.8 billion covering
   50.3 million people in 2012. In 2013, the the same program spent $266.2
   billion to cover 51.9 million people.

Will "pay less, get more" health care stick?

   We have had periods of relatively slow health care growth before. In
   the mid-1990s, for example, there was a stretch of time when health
   spending grew at the same rate as the rest of the economy. You can see
   that in this graph.

   health spending growth health spending growth

   Most health economists attribute that to the rise of health maintenance
   organizations, or HMOs, that sharply limited access to specialists.
   Patients, unsurprisingly, didn't like those limitations and there was a
   backlash. HMOs declined and health spending rose again.

   But some health economists say that this time feels different. For one,
   the changes are happening in private insurance and Medicare, suggesting
   there's no single — and thus easily reversible — force driving the
   change.

   And while there are more patients in narrow network products, something
   akin to HMOs, consumers are often choosing to be there. These are
   shoppers on the Obamacare exchanges who have decided to make a trade
   off: they're take lower premiums for less choice of doctor.

   "In the 1990s, people were essentially stuck in HMOs," M.I.T economist
   Gruber says. "This time, people are given an option and make a choice.
   That's why I'm more confident this slower growth will stick."

   Medicare actuaries are not fortune tellers; they do not have a crystal
   ball that conjures up the future of health care with perfect clarity.
   But at least at this particular moment, there are lots of signs
   cropping up to suggest something very important in health care is
   changing, and it's for the better.
