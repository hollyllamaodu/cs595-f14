The Next Big Thing in Well-Being

   [46]Comment Now
   [47]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   If you’re not supporting the emotional well-being of your employees,
   handing out pedometers or apples isn’t going to amount to much.

   Early in July, [48]Arianna Huffington in a post entitled, “Big
   [49]Business Finally Learns that Wellness is Good Business” offered an
   impressive [50]roundup of wellness initiatives that big businesses have
   taken on. What’s most significant is that big business is turning its
   sights to the impact that emotional well-being–stress management,
   resilience and mindfulness–can have on the productivity, capacity and
   motivation of people. And they are seeing it as a must have for every
   employee, right up there in importance with fitness, weight management,
   and healthy lifestyle programming. “Making sure employees have the
   inner resources,” as she describes it, is key, not only to their
   productivity but also, it turns out, to their physical well-being.

   This approach flies in the face of accepted thinking about work,
   stress, and wellness and it’s about time. Emotional well-being has
   conventionally been seen as the domain of crisis based solutions:
   employee assistance programs, counseling, hotlines. But today’s
   workforce is anything but conventional: The modern workforce has
   dizzying demands on their time, and they don’t all work one way, nor do
   they have the freedom to “only” work on one thing or another: about 75%
   of employees are parents; more than a third of employees are
   non-professional caregivers; and 47% of employees are part of
   dual-income households.

   Along with this shifting demographic, the new reality is that there are
   no hard lines between work and home, personal and professional. People
   now tend to bring their whole selves to work, including their stressors
   and emotions every day.

   In our work with employers who use meQuilibrium, our cloud-based
   solution for building the resilience of their employees, we see some
   very interesting correlations which support this.

   It’s not the job that stresses people

   It’s a common assumption that work alone causes stress, but in our
   experience, work itself is not the primary source of stress for most
   people. People who complete our stress assessment regularly cite
   family, success and money as their key sources of stress.  In other
   words, people consistently rank family and success as higher than their
   jobs when queried about what are their main sources of stress.

   Three powerful correlations between inner and outer well-being:
     * Sleep, eating habits, and physical fitness consistently correlate
       to stress levels. Self-esteem and how well connected one feels to
       their work positively correlate with sleep, eating habits and
       physical fitness. You do the math.

     * People who score low on getting regular exercise tend to have 20%
       lower resilience scores and correspondingly 47% higher stress index
       scores.

     * And people who scored high on ‘feeling overwhelmed’ and ‘being able
       to balance the competing demands in their lives’ had 29% lower
       resilience scores and 71% higher stress index scores.

   When employees suffer poor emotional well-being, they are more likely
   to be chronically stressed. In that state, they are much less able to
   make (and hold onto) the practical, healthy changes that would make a
   positive difference. The constant juggling act, trying to manage the
   competing demands of work and life is what erodes productivity and
   contributes to distraction, disconnection, depression, and ultimately,
   burnout.

   Bottom line, work isn’t the primary stressor—and yet the effect of
   addressing emotional wellness clearly plays out at work.  Even more, so
   it seems, than incentivizing people to work out or eat better.

       Spending a week scuba diving in the French Polynesia would
       exponentially increase emotional and physical well being. We are
       now offering luxury travel by private jet.
