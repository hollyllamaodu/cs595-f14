For Second Act, Acorda Drops $525 Million On Inhaled Parkinson's Drug

   [49]Comment Now

   A big all-cash deal just entered stage left for [51]Acorda Therapeutics
   [52]Acorda Therapeutics.

   Chief Executive Ron Cohen, 58, an internist and former off-Broadway
   actor, has built Acorda, which he founded in 1995, into a profitable
   concern with $355 million in sales over the past four quarters, almost
   all of it from Ampyra, a pill that helps multiple sclerosis patients
   maintain their ability to walk.

   Cohen, has also become a well-loved figure in biotech circles: well
   spoken, charming, and full of opinions on industry trends. His
   [53]Twitter [54]Twitter account? “[55]Ron Cohen’s Hair,” after a series
   of  jokes made by ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum, a Cohen fan.

   But lately Cohen’s savoir-faire hasn’t been enough to move the stock.
   Over the past 12 months, as the American Stock Exchange’s Biotechnology
   Index has increased 40%, Acorda shares are down 15% . Cohen’s
   prescription has been to promise an acquisition.

   “[Our] vision is the same as it’s been almost since inception which is
   to create the leading company, the leading innovator in the neurology
   space and a very healthy, growing, extremely high-value company, on
   behalf of shareholders as well as obviously patient communities that we
   want to serve,” Cohen told investors at the [56]Morgan Stanley
   [57]Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference on September 9.

   He praised his internal development pipeline, and then promised that he
   would do more: “To accelerate our ability to deliver on the promise of
   that pipeline, we also recognize that we need to be very active on the
   business development front and leverage the capabilities and the
   infrastructure that we’ve already built out in the Company so that that
   is being utilized most efficiently to create value.”

   Translated into plain English: a deal was coming. Cohen hired a new
   chief financial officer, Michael Rogers, a year ago. In May, he
   recruited Andrew Hindman, known for licensing in AIDS drugs at Gilead
   and a cancer drug at Onyx Pharmaceuticals, to be chief business
   officer. The first deal helped make Gilead the biggest player in HIV;
   the second resulted in Onyx being sold to [58]Amgen [59]Amgen for $10.4
   billion. At the Morgan Stanley conference, Cohen brought Hindman along,
   showing him off to investors.

   On June 18, Acorda did a convertible financing that double the amount
   of cash it had to more than $700 million. This morning, Cohen pulled
   the trigger.

   Acorda is spending $525 million to buy Civitas Therapeutics, a startup
   that had just recently raised $55 million from venture capitalists and
   that was actually on the road visiting investors to get them excited
   about its planned initial public offering when the deal came together.

   Civitas’ main asset is an inhaled form of levodopa, the main treatment
   for Parkinson’s disease. The pills patients currently take can wear
   off, leaving them with periods in which their tremors and other
   symptoms return. The inhaler could be used to rescue them at those
   moments.

   A rescue therapy might not sound that appealing, sales-wise. But in a
   phase II trial of the drug patients reached for the inhaler twice a
   day. There are 1 million Parkinson’s patients, about 700,000 of whom
   take levodopa. Half of those have off episodes. In the press release
   announcing today’s deal, Cohen said that he believes Civitas’ drug
   could generate more than $500 million in annual sales. Acorda shares
   are up nearly 9% in pre-market trading.
