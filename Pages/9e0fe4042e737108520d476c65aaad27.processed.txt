Alexander Hamilton's 10 Tips To Organizational Management

   [48]Comment Now
   [49]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Yes, that Alexander Hamilton.  Think you know how to run an
   organization? He is a couple centuries ahead of you.

   In a letter that has been for generations in a private collection, a
   letter [50]our firm handled earlier this summer, the nation’s first
   Secretary of the Treasury laid out his vision for how to not only run
   the organization but also to allow it to evolve. It’s “Management 101″
   from the school of Hamilton.

   Some background.  Hamilton’s rise to leadership was rapid. More than a
   decade younger than Thomas Jefferson, two decades the junior of his
   mentor, George Washington, Hamilton honed his skills as an apprentice
   clerk, tracking inventories and shipments for a mercantile business in
   the Caribbean. Within a decade of this, he would be serving under
   George Washington in the Continental Army, and in approximately 20
   years, he would be running the nation’s finances. Washington recognized
   his superior intellect and organizational skills, as well as his
   flexible and pragmatic mindset.

   Here are 10 things Hamilton’s letter teaches us about what in practice
   he saw as constituting effective management.  The letter is his
   philosophy in action.  In reading this, it is helpful to remember
   Hamilton’s employees were essentially collecting taxes on goods being
   imported into the United States, so his advice relates to that subject.

   Dateline: New York, October 2, 1789, to Stephen Smith, his collector in
   what is today the state of Maine.
   The start of Hamilton's letter, with the word "Circular" at the top,
   along with the date

   The start of Hamilton’s letter, with the word “Circular” at the top,
   along with the date. “Circular” would let one collector know that this
   was an organization-wide instruction and that other collectors would be
   getting the same exact letter.

   1) Communicate consistently and regularly: This letter is called a
   circular.  It is comparable to when today an executive might send a
   regular memo of important information to a leadership team.  It is
   written “circular” at the opening of the letter so that the recipient
   would know.  The collectors of customs, who were stationed in the
   various ports, received such communications with regularity, and major
   announcements usually contained the same messages sent to all.

   2) Make it easier for your employees to communicate with you: In this
   letter, he sends a form he created for his collectors to use in
   reporting back to him.  He also sets expectations of how often he is to
   receive these reports.  ”In mine of the 22nd of September, I directed
   you to render me a Weekly Account of your receipts and payments. I now
   enclose you a form for rendering this account, which I trust will be
   punctually complied with.”

   3) Never forget: your people on the ground are your eyes and ears, and
   they can help you evolve: “…Carefully note and from time to time
   communicate to me whatever may serve to discover the merits or defects
   of [my] plan, and to point out the means of improving it.”

   4) You can’t predict everything, so expect the unexpected:
   “Imperfections and inconveniences will naturally present themselves in
   practice, which could not have been foreseen in their formation; it is
   of the greatest moment that the best information should be collected
   for the use of the Government as to the operation of those which may
   have been adopted.”
   The closing of Hamilton's letter, which he signs "A. Hamilton,
   Secretary of the Treasury"

   The closing of Hamilton’s letter, signed “A. Hamilton, Secretary of the
   Treasury”

   5) Listen to criticism, even if it’s crazy: “Though the complaints of
   the Merchants will not always be infallible indications of defects, yet
   they will always merit attention, and when they occur, I shall be glad
   to be particularly informed of them.”

   6) Ask your employees for their input: “You will doubtless have
   observed, that it was in the contemplation of Congress to employ Boats
   for the security of the Revenue against contraband. I shall be glad to
   have your ideas as to the expediency of employing them in your quarter,
   and (if any appear to you necessary) of the number and kind you deem
   requisite; their equipments, and the probable expense.”

   7) Fix problems at the ground level: “It has been very much apprehended
   that the number of Ports in several of the States would conduce to
   great evasions of the duties. It is my wish to be informed how far
   experience has justified this apprehension, and what can be done to
   correct the Mischiefs which may have ensued, avoiding as much as
   possible the inconveniences which the multiplication of Ports was
   designed to obviate.”

   8) Encourage innovation broadly: “In hinting these particulars it is
   not my aim to confine your attention to them only; It will give me
   pleasure to find that your observation has been as diffusive as the
   object is extensive.”
   9) Set expectations early: This letter is just the second circular of
   serious consequence he sent, and he wrote this less than a month after
   he became the Secretary.

   10) Collect data. Even before the digital age, Hamilton was crunching
   numbers and gathering information.  The entire premise of this letter
   is data collection, positioning himself as the collector and analyzer
   of that information.

   That’s a lot to gather from one letter.  Here is a larger image of the
   first of the three pages.  Learn anything else?
