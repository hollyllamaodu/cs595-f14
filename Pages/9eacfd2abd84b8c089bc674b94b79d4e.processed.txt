       Every vote in Congress is an opportunity to see where our elected
       officials stand.
       When Harry Reid called votes this year to address the minimum wage,
       student loan debt, and equal pay for women, Americans got to see
       which senators had our backs.
       That's a pretty important part of how the system works, whether
       you're a citizen or an elected official—more than half a million
       OFA supporters have weighed in so far on those issues. So we're
       highlighting that support, name after name, to show Congress where
       we stand.
       [52]Post by [53]Barack Obama.
       When we asked OFA supporters what you cared most about fighting
       for, you were pretty clear that expanding economic opportunity for
       all Americans was at the top of your list of priorities.
       There are some big ways Congress can help right now.
       Raising the minimum wage would provide a much-needed pay raise to
       28 million Americans. Out-of-control student loan debt is holding
       back millions of families. And it's absolutely not OK that a man is
       paid more on average than a woman.
       Now, [54]get your name on the record that it's time to change that.
       When you go on the record, your support will be listed alongside
       hundreds of thousands of OFA supporters—that way you, your members
       of Congress, and anyone with an internet connection can see that
       you stand for economic opportunity.
       [55]Make sure you're on the record today:
