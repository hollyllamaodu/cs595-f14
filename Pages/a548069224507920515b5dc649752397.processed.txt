A New Federal Reserve Report Exposes A 'Low' U.S. Savings Rate As Mythical

   [43]Comment Now
   [44]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   “Capitals are increased by parsimony, and diminished by prodigality and
   misconduct.” Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations, p. 367

   Although any governmental report that presumes to put a number on total
   American wealth is bound to be riddled with inaccuracies, a Federal
   Reserve study last week revealed that American household wealth had
   risen to a record high of $81.5 trillion. Assuming the figures within
   are even passably accurate, they expose as false a lot of popular myths
   promoted by politicians, economists and the pundits who enable them.

   First and foremost, $81.5 trillion in household wealth puts to rest yet
   again the silly belief that Americans don’t save. If they didn’t save,
   they wouldn’t have household wealth in the first place.

   If Americans didn’t save, it also true that banks, investment banks,
   mutual fund companies, and money management firms offering all manner
   of vehicles for savings wouldn’t bombard them on a daily basis with
   calls, letters and advertisements begging them for their savings and
   investment accounts. Businesses focused on investing the savings of
   individuals thrive in the U.S. precisely because Americans are great
   savers.

   Of course, the fact that Americans are great savers similarly exposes
   as fraudulent frequent headlines of the “debt bubble” variety. Though
   savings migrate to the U.S. from around the world (those who have
   wealth want to put it to work where it’s going to be treated best, and
   where the most talented reside), the simple truth is that for every
   debtor there must be a saver. It’s arguably the most ironclad law of
   them all: for someone to borrow, someone must save first.

   The above truth exposes as wildly silly a popular view inside the same
   Fed that authored the study on American wealth. It comically and
   tragically believes that it can and should decree low rates of interest
   on saving. The idea behind such adolescent thinking is that low rates
   of interest will render credit ‘easy.’ Wrong. For credit to be ‘easy’,
   it must be that it’s ‘easy’ for savers to earn a market-based return on
   their savings. In that case, for the Fed to attempt to push interest
   rates below a natural level that would be achieved in actual markets is
   for the Fed to render credit tight.

   Taking this further, in cities, states and countries populated by the
   talented, the most basic of logic dictates that falsely arrogant
   central bankers needn’t worry about borrowing rates being too high.
   They don’t need to simply because the economically skillful are magnets
   for credit. The fact that Americans are so rich means that the Fed is
   wasting its time – and invariably reducing the amount of credit on
   offer – when it seeks to artificially lower the rates of interest paid
   to the savers whose savings make wealth creation possible.

   Mentioned earlier was the truth that savings reach the U.S. from around
   the world. Of course they do. Savings in dollars, euros and yen aren’t
   real resources, rather they’re the proverbial ‘tickets’ that can be
   exchanged for real resources. It’s only natural that the lion’s share
   of the world’s economic resources – meaning credit – would reach the
   richest and most productive people in the world. When the global
   economy grows, savings flow to where the wealth is being created.

   All borrowing is a function of saving, all demand begins with
   production first, and logically all credit that is accessed is a
   function of credit being offered. Contrary to Austrian School musings
   about “excess credit,” the truth is that there’s no such thing. Demand
   is once again balanced by supply, and so does credit accession balance
   with credit creation. Those who have much to offer can access a great
   deal through the borrowing mechanism.

   Applied to the U.S., it’s no surprise that Americans can borrow so
   much. They not only in aggregate have the most wealth in the world
   (their high savings mean they have the collateral to utilize the
   savings of others at low rates of interest), but they also represent
   the potential for staggering wealth creation.

   To understand why, consider Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, and Fred Smith.
   If tomorrow they were to give away every worldly possession, every
   Amazon, Oracle and FedEx share they own, and every dollar in their
   various bank and brokerage accounts, they would still be immensely
   wealthy. They would be because of who they are.

   Bezos, Ellison and Smith could tap enormous reserves of credit
   (resources) even without a cent to their names because of what they’ve
   done in the past, and by extension, what they could achieve with
   economic resources in the future. When individuals go to banks,
   investment banks and other financiers in search of credit, any
   transaction is balanced; money merely the facilitator of it. Money is
   just the medium of exchange used at banks that facilitates that which
   balances.

   Bezos, Ellison and Smith have lots of credit even without a cent to
   their name, while tomorrow’s entrepreneurs who would like to emulate
   the aforementioned entrepreneurs would – absent a track record – find
   attaining the economy’s resources a little bit more difficult at first.
   In short, the savings of others can often be had for something that is
   to some degree intangible in return: one’s reputation, or in the case
   of tomorrow’s success stories, one’s perceived future potential.

   Record American wealth reveals that Americans are great savers, while
   credit inflows into the U.S. strongly signal that American wealth
   extends well beyond what’s in our bank and brokerage accounts. Even in
   our relatively depressed state, our exploits remain attractive credit
   risks. Imagine how prosperous we would be absent all the barriers to
   growth that have been erected by Republicans and Democrats over the
   last twelve years.
