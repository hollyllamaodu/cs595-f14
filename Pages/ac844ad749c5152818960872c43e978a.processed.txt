   In an engaging and personal talk — with cameo appearances from his
   grandmother and Rosa Parks — human rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson shares
   some hard truths about America's justice system, starting with a
   massive imbalance along racial lines: a third of the country's black
   male population has been incarcerated at some point in their lives.
   These issues, which are wrapped up in America's unexamined history, are
   rarely talked about with this level of candor, insight and
   persuasiveness.
