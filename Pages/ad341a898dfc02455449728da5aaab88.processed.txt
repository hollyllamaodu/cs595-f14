Drones Are Coming To Hollywood: FAA Set To Announce Approval For Use In
Filming

   [47]Comment Now
   [48]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   The FAA will approve Hollywood’s request to use drones for filming,
   government and industry sources familiar with the process have told
   Forbes. On Thursday afternoon the FAA will announce its decision, and
   explain the procedures under which production companies will operate
   and the aviation rules which they are exempted from, the sources say.

   In May, seven aerial photo and video production companies asked for
   regulatory exemptions (known as a 333 exemption) that would allow the
   film and television industry to use drones with FAA approval. Those
   seven companies and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA),
   were asked by the FAA to develop the guidelines and safety procedures
   under which they planned to operate. The FAA reviewed those procedures
   and is expected to approve the drone-specific rules and standards that
   will enable Hollywood to be exempt from existing aviation regulations.

   The process was an onerous one that began more than four years ago with
   aerial cinematography companies working to develop internal guidelines.
   After filing their request for an exemption, the industry began
   drafting rules and guidelines, with the participation of pilots,
   lawyers, consultants, unmanned aviation experts, cinematographers,
   representatives from the studios, and experienced cinematography
   companies including Aerial Mob, Astraeus Aerial Cinema Systems,
   Flying-Cam Aerial Systems, Heli Video Productions, PictorVision,
   Snaproll Media and Vortex Aerial.

   A representative from Vortex Aerial, one of the companies involved in
   the exemption process, said, “We are very proud to be a part of this
   monumentally historical event. Being the result of over 4 years of
   industry leader collaboration we can only hope that this most daunting
   and financially taxing of tasks will finally come to fruition and not
   be yet another false start for our industry.”

   exemption process features this image on their website.

   The exemption is expected to specify detailed procedures under which
   companies may operate. The companies involved expect to release clear
   safety rules and guidelines that will set the standard for other
   companies to follow. The exemption allows the companies to fly pursuant
   to specific rules for the types of flights film productions plan to
   conduct. By definition, the exemption means that Hollywood will not
   need to to comply with some of the general flight rules covering pilot
   certificate requirements, manuals, maintenance and equipment mandates
   and certain airworthiness certification requirements.

   Hollywood is an appropriate industry to be granted one of the first
   exemptions, said Tony Carmean of [49]Aerial Mob, because it can address
   the FAA’s two major concerns: safety and privacy. “Most studio
   productions take place on closed sites with an established perimeter,
   ensuring that personnel on those sites are affiliated with the
   production and are aware of inbound aircraft,” he said. Aerial Mob has
   worked with clients such as the BBC, Nike, Harvard University and MTV.
    The company suspended all operations inside the United States while
   awaiting FAA approval, oftentimes filming in Mexico, which has a more
   permissive environment for aerial cinematography.

   The companies involved in the exemption process have extensive flight
   experience with both manned and unmanned aircraft, suggesting that
   certification as a pilot of manned aircraft may be a criteria that the
   FAA believes is important for the operation of unmanned aircraft.  To
   date, the FAA has received 45 requests for exemptions from large and
   small companies across a range of industries including agriculture, oil
   and gas, pipeline inspectors and surveyors.  “We have even received an
   exemption request from a realtor, and a person asking for permission to
   use a UAS for news gathering,” said FAA spokesman Les Dorr.

   Currently, Certificates of Waiver or Authorization are available to
   public entities that want to fly drones in civil airspace.  The FAA
   says that commercial operations are authorized on a case-by-case basis.
   Such operations require a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and
   operating approval. The exemption process under Section 333 provides an
   additional avenue for commercial UAS operations.
