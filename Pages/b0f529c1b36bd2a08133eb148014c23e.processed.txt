How To Earn More From Your Cash

   [44]Fidelity Viewpoints Team [45]Fidelity Viewpoints Team , Fidelity

   Generating yield in the short-term market is challenging—but it isn’t
   impossible. You may be able to boost the income your cash allocation
   produces if you’re willing to take on a bit more risk.

   To determine whether it makes sense to accept greater risk in exchange
   for greater yield potential, consider the purpose for your cash
   investments. In some cases, you may require absolute stability. In
   others you may be willing to accept some possibility of small declines
   in exchange for higher interest payments. The decision comes down to
   your needs: the role this allocation plays in your overall portfolio,
   and what you hope to get out of it given your needs and time horizon.

   You may be able to wring more yield from your cash by taking on the
   following risks:

   Credit risk

   Corporate issues pay significantly more yield than Treasuries, to
   compensate for the greater risk that the issuer will default. The
   greater the risk, the larger the yield premium a corporate bond or bill
   offers compared with a Treasury with a comparable term. The spread—the
   gap between yields—of corporate bonds over Treasury bonds grew to
   historically wide margins during the 2008 financial crisis, and since
   then has come down considerably.

   Interest rate risk

   Another way to secure higher yields is to hold securities with longer
   terms. In general, when two bonds with comparable credit quality have
   different maturity dates, the one with the longer term will typically
   pay more yield. But longer-term bonds carry greater interest rate risk:
   If the general level of interest rates rises, bond prices will usually
   fall—and they’ll fall further for longer-term bonds than for
   shorter-term bonds.

   A bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes is expressed by its
   duration (technically, the weighted average time until the bond’s
   future payments). As a rule of thumb, an investment-grade security with
   duration of 1.9 could be expected to lose approximately 1.9% each time
   interest rates rise by 1%. Likewise, it could gain 1.9% when interest
   rates drop by 1%.

   Considering that interest rates are hovering at or near their historic
   lows, they have much more room to go up than down, causing many
   investors to worry about potential interest rate risk. Some investors
   are limiting their holdings to very short-term securities to limit the
   damage from any interest rate hikes. But these investors are earning
   little to no yield on such securities—and no one knows when interest
   rates will rise.

   According to Kim Miller, manager of [46]Fidelity^® Conservative Income
   Bond Fund (FCONX), “An investor in a money market fund is probably
   earning between 0.01% and 0.10% right now. An investor willing to take
   on a little more price risk and principal volatility—less than a
   typical short- to intermediate-term bond fund might offer—could pick up
   between 0.20% and 0.30% in yield for some of their short-term assets by
   moving to a duration of three to six months.”

   In that case, you might consider shifting part of your short-term
   allocation to an ultra-short- or short-term bond fund. Or, if you
   prefer to invest through individual securities, you may want to build a
   ladder of bonds or CDs with sequential maturity dates—for example,
   holding equal amounts in securities with 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month
   maturities.

   “A six-month Treasury bill recently offered a 0.05% yield, a two-year
   Treasury note yielded 0.95%, and the three-year Treasury note as much
   as 0.95%,^2”says Richard Carter, Fidelity vice president of fixed
   income products and services. “That is a significant differential.
   Providing that you are comfortable with the staging of your maturities,
   have enough cash on hand to meet your needs, and invest in high quality
   credits, you can allow the investments to mature at par (the face value
   of a bond), and not concern yourself with day-to-day price and
   valuation changes.”

    Making your choice

   When deciding how to invest your cash, make liquidity—how quickly you
   need access to the money—a central consideration. In general, the more
   comfortable you are with risk and the less liquidity you need, the more
   yield you can afford to pursue.

   Consider the following hypothetical examples:

   Fidelity


   The bottom line

   Even in low-rate environments, there are ways to increase the returns
   on short-term investments. But with investing, there is no free lunch.
   More yield generally requires assuming more risk. The key: make sure
   your choices match up with your goals and your personal tolerance for
   risk.

   Before investing in any mutual fund, please carefully consider the
   investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. For this and other
   information, call or write Fidelity for a free prospectus or, if
   available, a summary prospectus. Read it carefully before you invest.

   1. Money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at
   $1 per share, and, while they are among the most conservative
   investment options, it is possible to lose money by investing in such
   funds. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or
   guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other
   government agency.

   2. Yields as of 3/18/14.

   Past performance does not guarantee future results.

   Neither diversification nor asset allocation ensures a profit or
   guarantees against loss.

   Credit ratings are forward-looking opinions about credit risk. Standard
   & Poor’s credit ratings express the agency’s opinion about the ability
   and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city
   government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.

   Credit ratings can also speak to the credit quality of an individual
   debt issue, such as a corporate note, a municipal bond, or a
   mortgage-backed security, and the relative likelihood that the issue
   may default.
   ‘AAA’—Extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments. Highest
   Rating.
   ‘AA’—Very strong capacity to meet financial commitments.
   ‘A’—Strong capacity to meet financial commitments, but somewhat
   susceptible to adverse economic conditions and changes in
   circumstances.
   ‘BBB’—Adequate capacity to meet financial commitments, but more subject
   to adverse economic conditions.
   ‘BBB-’—Considered lowest investment grade by market participants.
   ‘BB+’—Considered highest speculative grade by market participants.
   ‘BB’—Less vulnerable in the near-term but faces major ongoing
   uncertainties to adverse business, financial and economic conditions.
   ‘B’—More vulnerable to adverse business, financial, and economic
   conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial
   commitments.
   ‘CCC’—Currently vulnerable and dependent on favorable business,
   financial, and economic conditions to meet financial commitments.
   ‘CC’—Currently highly vulnerable.
   ‘C’—Currently highly vulnerable obligations and other defined
   circumstances.
   ‘D’—Payment default on financial commitments.

   disclaims any liability for any direct or incidental loss incurred by
   applying any of the information in this article. As with all your
   investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination as
   to whether an investment in any particular security or securities is
   consistent with your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial
   situation, and evaluation of the security. Fidelity is not recommending
   or endorsing these investments by making this article available to its
   customers.

   Consult your tax or financial adviser for information concerning your
   specific situation.

   In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities
   carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually
   fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for
   longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation
   risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties.
   Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date,
   so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price
   volatility is not possible. Lower-quality debt securities involve
   greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in
   the credit quality of the issuer.

   The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative, or
   political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of
   municipal securities.

   Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be
   subject to loss.

   Changes in government regulations, changes in interest rates, and
   economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in
   the financial services sector.

   For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository
   assets of the account holder at the institution that issued the CD will
   generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for
   each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover
   market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are
   FDIC insured. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.

   Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be
   subject to a substantial gain or loss. If sold prior to maturity, CDs
   may be sold on the secondary market subject to market conditions.

   Floating-rate loans generally are subject to restrictions on resale and
   they sometimes trade infrequently in the secondary market, and as a
   result may be more difficult to value, buy, or sell. A floating-rate
   loan might not be fully collateralized, which may cause the
   floating-rate loan to decline significantly in value.

   Increases in real interest rates can cause the price of
   inflation-protected debt securities to decrease.

   Interest income generated by Treasury bonds and certain securities
   issued by U.S. territories, possessions, agencies, and
   instrumentalities is generally exempt from state income tax but is
   generally subject to federal income and alternative minimum taxes and
   may be subject to state alternative minimum taxes.
