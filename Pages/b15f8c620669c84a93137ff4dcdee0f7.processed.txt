   Pollination: it's vital to life on Earth, but largely unseen by the
   human eye. Filmmaker Louie Schwartzberg shows us the intricate world of
   pollen and pollinators with gorgeous high-speed images from his film
   "Wings of Life," inspired by the vanishing of one of nature's primary
   pollinators, the honeybee.
