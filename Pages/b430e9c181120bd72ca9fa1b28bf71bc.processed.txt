   More than a dozen major U.S. companies — including Kroger, Target,
   Coca-Cola, Pepsi and DuPont — joined a new Obama administration push
   Tuesday to reduce use of a popular coolant that contributes to global
   warming by emitting a potent greenhouse gas.

   To show U.S. leadership on the issue in advance of next week's U.N.
   Climate Summit in New York City, the White House announced public and
   private commitments to cut emissions of hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs,
   factory-made gases used in many cars, homes and buildings for air
   conditioning or refrigeration.

   The pledges by 19 companies and two industry groups cover the entire
   HFC supply chain, from the chemical's production to its use in
   manufacturing and stores. The administration said it will reduce its
   use in federal buildings, approve more climate-friendly alternatives
   and fund research to develop next-generation cooling technologies.

   HFCs, which largely replaced ozone-depleting chemicals such as Freon,
   accounts for a small share of the world's heat-trapping greenhouse
   gases, but it's nearly 10,000 times as potent as carbon dioxide.
   Without action, its emissions are expected to nearly double by 2020 and
   triple by 2030.

   "The good progress we are making on restoring the earth's ozone layer
   would not have been possible without a strong public-private
   partnership," said Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina
   McCarthy. "By working together again, we can tackle the challenges of
   climate change."

   The White House announcement came on International Ozone Day, created
   by the United Nations General Assembly in 1994 to mark the official
   beginning of the Montreal Protocol, an environment treaty ratified by
   196 countries to rid the world of ozone-depleting substances. Last
   week, a U.N. report said the phase-out of these chemicals is finally
   allowing the recovery of the ozone layer, which shields life from
   cancer-causing solar rays.

   "Today's actions will build momentum for an amendment to the Montreal
   Protocol to phase down the global production and consumptions of HFCs,"
   said the White House's Council on Environmental Quality. The CEQ said
   the new steps could cut greenhouse gases the equivalent of taking
   nearly 15 million cars off the road for 10 years.

   The Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, an industry
   group, announced it will invest $5 billion over the next decade to
   research and develop new refrigerants and the equipment in which
   they'll be used.

   • PepsiCo, the soft-drink maker, announced it will try to buy only
   HFC-free vending machines and other point-of-sale equipment by 2020 and
   will begin such U.S. purchases next year.

   • Coca-Cola, which has set a similar goal for its new cold drink
   equipment, said it has bought 20,000 HFC-free units this year in the
   USA and now has more than 1 million such units worldwide.

   • Red Bull, maker of energy drinks, said it will order an estimated
   32,000 climate-friendly hydrocarbon coolers for 2015.

   • Target, retailer with nearly 1,800 U.S. stores, recently opened two
   cold-storage facilities that use ammonia, an HFC-free refrigerant, and
   plans to open two stores next year that use carbon dioxide
   refrigeration. It already has five stores with the CO2 technology.

   • Kroger, the supermarket chain, said it's joining the EPA's Green
   Chill program as part of its push to use advanced refrigeration
   technologies wherever feasible and share its best practices for
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

   • DuPont, the company that invented fluorinated refrigerants, said it
   has five new products for use in cars and buildings that will reduce
   emissions and can also boost energy efficiency. It said they can be
   used in a lot of existing equipment with "minimal" changes.

   "We see strong global demand for these products," says Kathryn McCord,
   global business director of DuPont Fluorochemicals. By the end of 2014,
   she expects 3 million cars in the USA and Europe will use its new
   Opteon YF refrigerant, which emits 99.9% fewer greenhouse gases than
   the product it replaces.

   Other companies signing on to the Obama administration's HFC phasedown
   include: Arkema, Carrier, Danfoss, Emerson Climate Technologies,
   Goodman Manufacturing, Hillphoenix, Honeywell, Johnson Controls,
   Lapolla, Mission Pharmacal, SEVO Systems, Thermo King and True
   Manufacturing.
