   I've written about health care for more than two decades, starting from
   my native Iowa where I covered the presidential campaign bus rides of
   Bill and Hillary Clinton through the Hawkeye state talking health
   reform and the economy. I have covered the rise, fall and rise again of
   health reform, chronicling national trends as well as the influence of
   Barack and Michelle Obama from Chicago's South Side on changes to the
   U.S. health system from my base in Chicago. I am the author of the new
   Forbes signature series book, "Inside Obamacare: The Fix For America's
   Ailing Health Care System." I was health care business reporter at the
   Chicago Tribune (1998-2011) and previously wrote for Modern Healthcare
   magazine when first arriving in Chicago in 1993. Prior to that, I wrote
   for several Iowa newspapers including the Des Moines Register. These
   days, I contribute stories to the New York Times, Chicago Medicine
   magazine and teach in the University of Iowa School of Journalism MA in
   Strategic Communication program. You can see me nationally on Fox News
   Channel's "Forbes on Fox" show. In Chicago, you can hear my health
   segments and business analysis on WBBM newsradio 780 and 105.9 FM. I am
   passionate about health literacy when it comes to explaining the
   complexities of health care. A better understood health system may save
   someone some money or their life.

Young Physicians OK With Obamacare While Older Doctors Bristle

   Though U.S. physicians continue to have issues with the Affordable Care
   Act, it appears to be a generational taste developing of the law making
   sweeping changes to their profession.

   More than half, or 50.8 percent, of doctors 46 years of age and older
   give the [49]health law a “D” or “F” while just 37 percent of doctors
   45 and younger give the legislation such poor grades, [50]a new survey
   released last week of physicians commissioned [51]by The Physicians
   Foundation.

   Meanwhile, nearly 30 percent of the younger doctors gave the health law
   an “A” or “B” when asked: “What overall grade would you give the
   Affordable Care Act as a vehicle for healthcare reform?” One-third, or
   33.1 percent of doctors 45 and younger gave the law a “C.”

   By comparison, just 22.9 percent of the older doctors gave the law an
   “A” or “B” with 26 percent giving it a “C,” t[52]he survey shows.

   The survey comes as the ACA and other forces are moving doctors away
   from fee-for-service medicine that allows doctors to order procedures
   and tests liberally as opposed to more value-based care that encourages
   evidence-based approaches to treatment and reimbursement for keeping
   patients healthy.

   A reason for the generational differences could be that younger doctors
   aren’t as close to the bureaucracy of insurance and changes in
   reimbursement since more physicians are leaving private practice to
   become employed.
   [53]The Forbes eBook On Obamacare
   [54]Inside Obamacare: The Fix For America’s Ailing Health Care System
   explores the ways the Affordable Care Act will affect your health care
   and is available for download now.

   “Physicians are younger, more are working in employed practice settings
   and more are leaving private practice,” said Dr. Walker Ray, vice
   president of The Physicians Foundation and chair of its research
   committee.

   No matter the age of the doctor, they are feeling the impact of the
   health law and the more than 8 million Americans who signed up for
   subsidized private coverage for this year. In addition, millions more
   Americans are getting coverage via the expanded Medicaid insurance
   program for the poor.

   These newly insured patients are contributing to a stress on the
   physician workforce with “81 percent of physicians” describing
   themselves as “either over-extended or at full capacity,” the
   foundation said.

   Here are some other highlights of the survey, conducted online of
   20,000 physicians from March 2014 through June 2014 for the foundation
   by physician staffing firm MerrittHawkins.
     *     56 percent of physicians describe their morale as very negative
       to somewhat negative
     *     17 percent of doctors are in solo practices compared to 25
       percent in 2012
     *     39 percent of physicians say they will “accelerate their
       retirement plans” due to changes in health care
     *     71 percent of doctors say they would still become a physician
       if they had to do it all over again

   Wondering how Obamacare will affect your doctor and your health care?
   The Forbes eBook [55]Inside Obamacare: The Fix For America’s Ailing
   Health Care Systemanswers that question and more. Available now [56]at
   Amazon and [57]Apple.

       Remember the “good old days” when a doctor could have few patients
       and make lots of money and if you were to old and had serious
       problems that took to much of their time told you good bye. I saw
       this happen with my parents with their “private” doctors. Times
       have changed, more people are getting covered and per patient
       doctors don’t make as much.
       Do we need to lower the cost of education for doctors, yes and most
       of the problem is he method we use to get them to become doctors.
       Do they need all the “garbage” courses for “credits” perhaps a
       system that teaches doctors their “trade” would be much less money
       and allow years off schooling before they graduate.

       Can’t lower the cost. It only goes up as ALWAYS. The training is
       harder & more demanding years after years, so, the pre-Doc training
       & the Doc-training can’t be cut shorter, or else nobody could
       handle the demanding (& I’m talking about the brain ones, not just
       any one). Also, The US doesn’t train Docs ONLY to take care of
       patients (like in many other countries), they train Docs into
       medicine research-capable ones. That’s why medicine is so advancing
       in the US now & in the long run. BUT, then, the cost will be so
       high.

       Right on with your comment. I was typing the following when I read
       your comment;
       Help me understand this: Only 30% of young doctors gave Obamacare a
       “positive” rating (A or B) yet the headline to this article
       portrays these young doctors as happy with Obamacare and olders
       docs as “bristling” about Obamacare? smh

       The ACA does not address healthcare “COST”!!! It only asks more
       people to “PAY”. Take a look at the map of world healthcare costs
       and you will see the United States at the top of the list.
       “WHY”?……Not only that, the ACA makes you pay for things like the
       skateboarder who thought he could jump the grand canyon,,,or the
       idiot who had unprotected sex and caught a
       disease,,,etc,,,etc,,etc,,,,……The ACA is the worst law EVER!!!

       That because its easy to make a decision, when you know nothing
       about being a doctor. The major amount of your illness come from
       years of experience, and getting working 24/7 not like today young
       doctors 8/5 and off on Wednesday.

       Seriously, the headline is that “young doctors are OK wtho
       Obamacare.” Really. How do you get to that when 70% of younger
       doctors gave it a C-F. Taking over 16% of the economy for a C-F?
       What a bunch of spin. I expect a little more creditability and
       objectivity in articles posted on Forbes.

       The public has no clue as to the extent of decline in graduate
       medical eduction over the last two decades. Most of the “young
       doctors’ would not pass muster as 4th year medical students 30
       years ago due to the relaxation of standards for performance and
       fund of knowledge. Substitution of algorithms for clinical judgment
       along with training programs desire to please has resulted in a
       losing combination of arrogance and ignorance destined to find the
       next generation of “doctors” losing their jobs to physicians
       assistants and nurse practitioners, the ultimate goal of the
       business interests now controlling health care in America.

       The Young doctors in my area are working in clinics supported by
       Hospitals in the area. They are on a set salary. So far my wife and
       I have had very good results with the doctors. We are on medicare
       and have not been turned down.
