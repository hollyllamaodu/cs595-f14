   [45]15 Websites To Jump Start Your Career

   In writing about careers for Forbes, I have the opportunity to
   research, utilize, and work in tandem with some of the best online
   resources available to employees and job seekers. Last week, I put out
   a call for submissions on Forbes.com and Twitter, asking readers to
   tell me what sites they’re using to find jobs, network, and explore
   career resources.

   The responses were a diverse collection of recommendations for sites
   that ranged from the biggest names in the online job search sphere to
   smaller sites focused on a particular industry or type of professional.

   Many readers suggested mobile apps, and while I’ve limited this list to
   websites, those nominations were a good reminder of the different ways
   professionals are now accessing resources, and one I may explore in a
   future post. Responses also indicated that an increasing number of job
   seekers are turning away from traditional job sites and listings and
   towards social media and crowd sourcing to find their next opportunity.
   I’ve included a round-up of suggested social platforms in the “See
   also” section at the end of this post.

   Even in 2014, in-person communication still trumps digital, offering
   professionals a much better chance at a bold, lasting impression. As my
   colleague Susan Adams [46]reminded readers last year, it’s far better
   to limit online endeavors to researching companies and focus the bulk
   of your efforts on face-to-face networking.
   instagramhiring

   Many job seekers are taking their hunt to social media platforms like
   Instagram, where an increasing number of employers share opportunities.

   This list is not a ranking, and it’s far from a comprehensive run-down
   of all the web has to offer professionals. Rather, I hope to provide a
   jumping-off point for a wide spectrum of professionals at different
   stages of their career, who might have a few different objectives.
   [47]Whether you’re kicking off a job hunt, preparing to ask for a
   raise, or just looking to refresh your personal brand, these sites
   offer a vast array of resources for any juncture in your career or job
   search.

   15 Websites To Jump Start Your Career

   [48]AngelList
   This is the site for job seekers looking to enter the startup world or
   transition to a new role. AngelList’s careers function is private, so
   job seekers are only visible to companies with which they apply. More
   than 5,000 startups currently use the site, salary and equity
   information is provided up front with each job posting, and no
   recruiters are allowed.

   [49]CareerBliss
   Fulfillment-focused site CareerBliss allows users to find jobs,
   salaries, and employee-generated company reviews, all with an emphasis
   on a positive workplace experience. Company reviews are broken down by
   metrics including company culture, growth opportunities, coworkers,
   manager, rewards, and work environment.

   [50]CareerBuilder
   Each month more than 24 million unique visitors head to CareerBuilder,
   which currently serves more than 60 markets around the world, to post
   resumes and search for jobs. The site’s resources portal offers job
   seekers advice on topics like how to follow-up after an interview and
   ways to avoid awkward conference calls.
   [51]The Forbes eBook To Succeed In A Brutal Job Market
   [52]Don’t let a rotten economy spoil your goals. Use the career and
   money advice in The Millennial Game Plan to get and stay ahead for
   good.

   [53]Dice
   The tech industry-focused site has been helping employers and
   recruiters find “hard-to-find, experienced and qualified technology and
   engineering candidates” for more than two decades, and currently lists
   upwards of 80,000 jobs. Dice also maintains a career news and
   advice-focused blog and digital communities for programmers and women
   in technology.

   [54]Executive Drafts
   A company that wants to help job seekers “look great on paper,”
   Executive Drafts provides resume analysis and revisions and interview
   prep—for a fee. Packages tailored to different tiers of a career are
   available: $149 buys “The Graduate,” which includes a phone
   consultation and a final resume draft, while “The Executive” rings in
   at $449 and includes services like a customized cover letter, interview
   prep, help with salary negotiations, and multiple resume drafts and
   revisions.

   [55]Glassdoor
   Using information sourced entirely from employees, Glassdoor provides a
   raft of data by which job seekers and potential employees can evaluate
   companies, including “6 million company reviews, CEO approval
   ratings, salary reports, interview reviews and questions, benefits
   reviews, office photos and more.”

   [56]Idealist
   Founded with a mission “to close the gap between intention and action
   by connecting people, organizations, ideas, and resources,” Idealist
   provides users a forum to search for jobs, internships, volunteer
   opportunities, and events at and through organizations related to
   community and social justice issues.

   [57]Indeed
   Indeed crawls the internet, so you don’t have to—at least quite as
   much. Indeed aggregates job openings from a vast array of sources
   across the web including company websites, online job boards,
   newspapers, industry organizations, and staffing firms.
   [58]LinkedIn [59]LinkedIn
   The massive global professional networking site offers job search
   capabilities and thought leadership, but the ability to seek and make
   professional connections is the service upon which it was founded. The
   world’s largest digital professional network, LinkedIn is now available
   in 23 languages and has more than 313 million registered users
   worldwide.

   [60]Monster
   One of the original online career boards, Monster allows people in more
   than 40 countries to post resumes and search for jobs. Recently, the
   company has focused new attention on placing employees with small
   businesses, and introduced a tool that allows employers and job seekers
   to communicate directly within the platform. The acquisition of social
   profile search engine TalentBin has also allowed the company to recruit
   among “passive job seekers”—those who are not currently searching for
   employment but could be interested in the right opportunity—largely in
   the tech sector.

   [61]PayScale
   PayScale helps job seekers better evaluate offers and employees
   consider their current compensation by letting users search and compare
   salary data from “more than 35 million people, covering 12,000 unique
   job titles.”

   [62]SimplyHired
   SimplyHired tracks the search characteristics of over 30 million unique
   users each month to provide the most relevant job search results
   possible. Currently, the site lists 6 million open jobs in upwards of
   974 occupations in the U.S., sourced from company sites, job boards,
   and listings across the web.

   [63]USAJOBS
   “The Federal Government’s Official Job Site,” USAJOBS is a free jobs
   board that provides those seeking work within the federal government
   with “access to thousands of job opportunities across hundreds of
   federal agencies and organizations.” Users can create an account and
   post or build a resume to submit, as well as search for positions based
   on agency, title, or salary. A resource center provides tutorials and
   tips for job seekers, as well information on topics including
   eligibility, compensation, and federal occupations by college major.

   [64]VetNet
   A project of Hire Heroes USA and [65]Syracuse University’s Institute
   for Veterans and Military Families, VetNet provides career resources
   including videos, resume tutorials, and information about events all
   aimed towards helping veterans transition to civilian professional
   life.

   [66]ZipRecruiter
   ZipRecruiter allows job seekers to search across hundreds of job boards
   with one click, and uses sophisticated back-end technology to provide
   employers the most relevant options from a deep pool of job seekers who
   post their resume to the site’s database; view, save, and apply for
   jobs; and sign up to receive the site’s daily emails with targeted job
   postings.

   See also: Craigslist, Facebook, Instagram, Meetup, [67]Reddit – For
   Hire, Twitter/Tweetdeck, WordPress, YouTube.

       I believe a great networking and career platform is MySlate.com.
       Instead of finding jobs, qualified candidates get matched with open
       positions. We eliminate the hunt so job seekers and companies can
       focus on what really matters: only engaging in connections that
       will materialize.

       Though we focus on a more narrow scope of careers, we’ve invested
       considerable time and energy into making EngineerJobs.com the
       single best place on the web to find a job if you’re an engineer or
       engineering technician (CAD, surveyors, true technicians, NDT
       specialists, etc.) in the United States and Canada. Our magazine,
       now 2 years old, has hundreds of articles covering everything from
       how to get a job with a low GPA, whether you should pursue an MBA/
       MA, features on specific employers and even mundane but necessary
       topics like how to engineer a job-winning cover letter.

       Let’s just remember that all of these websites and all of ones good
       intentions may play well but nothing works better than who you
       know. Today the majority of hiring managers have learned how to
       play the game and win. Successful candidates are still mostly
       personal referrals or specifically targeted. It’s not fair and it
       never will be just as life itself isn’t fair. In my personal
       opinion and experience, discrimination is rampant and responsible
       for a new breed who know that they have to work harder, run faster
       and continuously reinvent themselves by reinvesting in themselves.
       It takes perseverance and the ability to acknowledge and accept
       that it’s just business, not personal.

       Since I am working in the sports industry, www.sportyjob.com is a
       great place to find jobs – I really love that you can connect the
       side with LinkedIn, which is a very handy feature.

       I can second www.ExecutiveDrafts.com if you need a resume and want
       someone to really sit down with you and make it perfect. The
       increase in callbacks and opportunities easily justifies the one
       time expense.

       LinkedIn has a number of different ways you can use it to land a
       job, like maximizing your profile, joining relevant groups, and
       reading, writing, and responding to articles:
