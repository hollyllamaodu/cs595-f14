       [45]Zak Ebrahim [46]I am the son of a terrorist. Here's how I chose
       peace.
       If you’re raised on dogma and hate, can you choose a different
       path? Zak Ebrahim was just seven years old when his father helped
       plan the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. His story is shocking,
       powerful and, ultimately, inspiring.

       [50]John Hunter [51]Teaching with the World Peace Game
       John Hunter puts all the problems of the world on a 4'x5' plywood
       board — and lets his 4th-graders solve them. At TED2011, he
       explains how his World Peace Game engages schoolkids, and why the
       complex lessons it teaches — spontaneous, and always surprising —
       go further than classroom lectures can.

       [55]Jody Williams [56]A realistic vision for world peace
       Nobel Peace laureate Jody Williams brings tough love to the dream
       of world peace, with her razor-sharp take on what "peace" really
       means, and a set of profound stories that zero in on the creative
       struggle — and sacrifice — of those who work for it.

       [60]Paul Collier [61]New rules for rebuilding a broken nation
       Long conflict can wreck a country, leaving behind poverty and
       chaos. But what's the right way to help war-torn countries rebuild?
       At TED@State, Paul Collier explains the problems with current
       post-conflict aid plans, and suggests 3 ideas for a better
       approach.

       [65]Scilla Elworthy [66]Fighting with nonviolence
       How do you deal with a bully without becoming a thug? In this wise
       and soulful talk, peace activist Scilla Elworthy maps out the
       skills we need — as nations and individuals — to fight extreme
       force without using force in return. To answer the question of why
       and how nonviolence works, she evokes historical heroes — Aung San
       Suu Kyi, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela — and the personal
       philosophies that powered their peaceful protests.

       One of a dozen Pakistanis who came to TEDIndia despite security
       hassles entering the country, TED Fellow Asher Hasan shows photos
       of ordinary Pakistanis that drive home a profound message for
       citizens of all nations: look beyond disputes, and see the humanity
       we share.

       [75]Ashraf Ghani [76]How to rebuild a broken state
       Ashraf Ghani's passionate and powerful 10-minute talk, emphasizing
       the necessity of both economic investment and design ingenuity to
       rebuild broken states, is followed by a conversation with TED
       curator Chris Anderson on the future of Afghanistan.

       [80]Julia Bacha [81]Pay attention to nonviolence
       In 2003, the Palestinian village of Budrus mounted a 10-month-long
       nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive
       groves. Did you hear about it? Didn't think so. Brazilian filmmaker
       Julia Bacha asks why we only pay attention to violence in the
       Israel-Palestine conflict — and not to the nonviolent leaders who
       may one day bring peace.

       [85]Jeremy Gilley [86]One day of peace
       Here's a crazy idea: Persuade the world to try living in peace for
       just one day, every September 21. In this energetic, honest talk,
       Jeremy Gilley tells the story of how this crazy idea became real —
       real enough to help millions of kids in war-torn regions.
