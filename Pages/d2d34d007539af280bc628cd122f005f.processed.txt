“There’s no debate”: 97 experts explain the scientific consensus on climate
change

Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree: The planet is warming, and human
activity is to blame

   [131]"There's no debate": 97 experts explain the scientific consensus
   on climate change (Credit: [132]lexaarts/Shutterstock)

   While the vast majority of the scientific community agrees that
   man-made climate change is happening, the public is still working to
   catch up: Even among those who accept that it’s probably a thing,
   [133]not nearly enough appear to understand [134]just how certain most
   scientists are about the basic relationship between human activity and
   Earth’s warming.

   Not that we aren’t making progress. Politicians are [135]listing
   humanity’s continued contribution of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
   among their top concerns and [136]risking attack should they continue
   to deny the scientific facts. On my subway ride to work, colorful
   advertisements are urging me to show up in Columbus Circle two weeks
   from now to participate in what organizers are promising to be the
   biggest climate march in history. And on social media, the climate
   science website [137]Skeptical Science has launched a 97-hour campaign
   — begun, naturally, on 9/7 — highlighting the 97 percent scientific
   consensus, and featuring 97 forceful, tweetable quotes from 97 experts.

   As their statements attest, anyone who tries to argue that climate
   change is some fringe theory, or not nearly as settled as
   “environmentalists and the liberal media” make it seem, is picking a
   fight with not just some scientists, but nearly all the scientists.
   Fortunately for us, some of the top climate experts also happen to
   be [138]excellent science communicators. There’s still a lot to come,
   but some highlights from the campaign so far prove they’re up to the
   task of explaining both why we should believe climate change is
   happening, and — crucially — why we should care:
