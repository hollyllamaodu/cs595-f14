   I write about stock markets, art markets, millennials and their money.
   Before joining the markets and personal finance desk I produced the
   investing section of Forbes.com. In that role I helped our illustrious
   team of contributors make the most of our site.
   Not long ago, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I
   majored in English and minored in art history but mostly worked at the
   student newspaper – The Daily Pennsylvanian. At the DP I served as
   managing editor and later explored art, journalism and other ways we
   express ourselves in a weekly opinion column. You can follow me on
   Twitter [37]@SamSharf and email me at ssharf@forbes.com.

Apple Leads Q2 Buyback Pack As Share Repurchases Decline Overall

   [44]Comment Now
   [45]Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   Is there a stock list that [46]Apple [47]Apple doesn’t top? The iPhone
   maker is the [48]largest S&P component. Retail investors trade
   it [49]more than any other stock. The company pays [50]more cash in
   dividends than any other.  And today, S&P Dow Jones Indices again
   confirmed Apple also buys back more of its own shares.

   Apple repurchased $5 billion worth of stock in the second quarter of
   2014. According to an analysis released by S&P Tuesday, [51]IBM
   [52]IBM, [53]Exxon Mobil [54]Exxon Mobil, [55]Wells Fargo [56]Wells
   Fargo and [57]Intel [58]Intel also bought big in the second quarter,
   but overall share repurchases were down 1.6% from the same period last
   year to $116.2 billion. Apple was not immune from this pattern. Its $5
   billion is down sharply from $16 billion in the second quarter of 2013
   (a record for any company at the time).

   [59]The 20 Largest Q2 2014 Buybacks

   Nevertheless, the overall annual trend is positive. For the 12 months
   that ended in June, S&P 500 components increased their buyback
   expenditures 26.6% to $533 billion. The gains were driven in part by a
   strong first quarter. The $159.3 billion spent on stock buybacks in Q1
   made it the second largest repurchase quarter on record.

   Again, Apple ushered the trend. Tim Cook and Co. bought back $18
   billion in Q1 (setting a new record). The company’s total so far this
   calendar year is therefore close to $23 billion. It is therefore likely
   Apple will beat the $26 billion it bought back in 2013.

   As FORBES Markets Editor [60]Steve Schaefer reported, the CEO was
   spurred on by billionaire [61]Carl Icahn. The activist investor went on
   a “crusade” earlier this year insisting Apple buyback more stock to
   correct what Icahn called “‘a dramatic valuation disconnect’ between
   the company’s shares and the broader market.” In a February letter to
   Apple shareholders Icahn called the company “perhaps the most
   overcapitalized company in corporate history.” Icahn [62]eventually
   backed down and a few months later Apple announced plans [63]to return
   $130 billion to shareholders including up to $90 billion in buybacks.

       But there are a lot of Apple haters out there who claim Apple is
       throwing its money away when they should be using that money for
       acquisitions or R&D. Apple really can’t win. There are always
       self-proclaimed geniuses out there who swear they know how to run a
       company better than Apple. They’re nothing but blowhards trying to
       get attention for themselves. They should keep their mouths shut
       and keep their eyes on how well Apple does. No company is perfect,
       but Apple doesn’t deserve to be second-guessed by a bunch of
       nincompoops, either.
       Apple does what many other companies do and gets good results but
       the news media and pundits are always quick to nitpick about
       whatever Apple does. How much wealth does Apple have to have in
       order for these know-it-alls to shut up with their stupid theories
       about how if they had the chance to run Apple, the company would be
       making a lot more money? If it were that easy to make loads of
       revenue and profits, every company would be where Apple is now.
