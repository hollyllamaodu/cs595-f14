   Eman Mohammed is one of the few female photojournalists in the Gaza
   Strip. Though openly shunned by many of her male colleagues, she is
   given unprecedented access to areas denied to men. In this short,
   visual talk, the TED Fellow critiques gender norms in her community by
   bringing light to hidden stories.
