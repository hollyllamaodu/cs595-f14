     * [49]Californians fought for clean energy choices—and won
    This is what happened when the other side tried to hamper local
       efforts to combat climate change.

       A major part of fighting back against climate change is helping our
       local communities switch to clean energy.
       California allows communities to fight climate change by buying
       clean energy for themselves—something called [52]community choice
       aggregation. Just last year, OFA California volunteers worked with
       partners to help Sonoma County approve a measure to [53]choose
       clean renewable energy.
       This summer, however, the California State Assembly considered a
       measure that would have gutted community choice legislation,
       creating roadblocks to cities and counties that want to do the
       right thing on climate change by switching to clean energy. That's
       when supporters in California swung into action.
       [97bf57e0959c4b85aa420ed5c5d69cb5_2014casmile_reg.jpg] We joined a
       coalition of more than 100 partner organizations by making phone
       calls, holding rallies, visiting legislative offices, and
       recruiting people to attend public hearings—including one
       jam-packed State Senate hearing in June.
       [0085294558db43e4ac1587a312427a47_201409ca_vote_edit.jpg] That work
       paid off. The bill to roll back community choice in California
       failed at the end of the legislative session.

       It’s yet another great example of how, when we organize, we can win
       key fights against tough odds, and keep making progress in our
       country’s switch to clean energy.
       These fights are popping up all over the country. [58]Are you ready
       to get involved?
