   Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your
   forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health
   enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you
   believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to
   see stress as a positive, and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for
   stress reduction: reaching out to others.
