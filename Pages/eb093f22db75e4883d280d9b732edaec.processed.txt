   Imagine a country where girls must sneak out to go to school, with
   deadly consequences if they get caught learning. This was Afghanistan
   under the Taliban, and traces of that danger remain today. 22-year-old
   Shabana Basij-Rasikh runs a school for girls in Afghanistan. She
   celebrates the power of a family's decision to believe in their
   daughters — and tells the story of one brave father who stood up to
   local threats. (Filmed at TEDxWomen)
