   Samsung has covered a lot of health and fitness bases on the Galaxy S5
   [INS: :INS]

   Health and fitness has a big focus in the Samsung Galaxy S5, something
   we learned from the very moment it was introduced on stage. Samsung is
   making it easy to get involved in tracking your activity with the heart
   rate sensor on the back of the phone and the first-party S Health
   application.

             Read: [24]14 things every Galaxy S5 owner should do

   S Health is a nice and easy way to pay more attention to your activity
   levels without the need for any wristbands or paying for any apps.
   Here's what it can do for you.

   The pedometer

   Part of the S Health app is the step counter, where the phone will act
   as a pedometer recording your steps and feeding that information into
   the app. It also – should you wish it to – display your steps on the
   lockscreen. A couple of design issues aside, the Galaxy S5 does a great
   job of counting your daily steps and giving you a figure for how many
   calories you've burned throughout the day.

   As time goes by and you want to look back through your history, S
   Health will give you options to view your activities by hour, day and
   month by tapping the graph icon in the very bottom right corner as well
   as presenting a log in list form of your entire history.

   You can also hook in supported accessories that will record the data
   for you and then feed it into S Health. The app says "Samsung
   accessories" so it doesn't look so hot for your Fitbit right now.

   The heart rate monitor

        Read: [27]How to use the Heart Rate Monitor on the Galaxy S5

   The Galaxy S5 has a heart rate monitor round the back that plugs right
   into the S Health app. Whether you're just curious or whether or not
   you're going to use it during your workouts, it's a pretty handy thing
   to have close by. If you're wanting all there is to know about the
   heart rate monitor, hit up the link below.

   Tracking your fitness

             [28]Using the S Health app on the Samsung Galaxy S5

   [INS: :INS]

   The pedometer is something that you can, and probably would use every
   day. But buried within S Health are a whole bunch of different options
   for tracking your health, fitness and overall well being. Let's break
   it down:
     * Exercise - Options to track your work outs for running, walking,
       cycling and hiking. S Health will then track your route, distance
       covered and calories burned while you're exercising. Within the
       workout screen you get quick options to take photographs while
       you're on the go and to access the stock Samsung music player so
       you don't need to actually leave S Health to change your workout
       tunes. You're also given the option to see a whole bunch of more
       detailed stats like average and maximum speeds, pace and your heart
       rate info should you have used the heart rate sensor during the
       workout. It's a really involved part of the app, but since it's a
       major focus it's good to have all these features on hand.
     * Food - Part of a healthy lifestyle is the food you eat. S Health
       gives you a dedicated section to track your food intake and gives
       you the option to view as graphs by hour, day and month.
     * Weight - If you're trying to get/keep fit, you're going to be
       interested in monitoring your weight. You get the same stat viewing
       options as for food and the pedometer and a simple method of
       entering and updating your numbers.
     * Sleep - "Samsung wearable accessories can record your sleep data
       and sync it with sleep in S Health." Otherwise it's basically
       useless to you.
     * Stress - Uses the heart rate monitor to take an extended reading
       with a view to interpreting your stress levels. Because, who wants
       to be stressed?
     * Coach - There to help you get motivated in your fitness regime by
       collecting your goals and setting you challenges.

   If you're serious about using your Galaxy S5 to help monitor your
   health and fitness, then you could do a lot worse than S Health. It's
   more than just an app, with connected devices like the Gear Fit that
   can assist in collecting the data, Samsung has built the foundations of
   a platform.

   This is, of course, just a quick run through of what you can do with
   it. If you're already putting it to work be sure to drop a note in the
   comments with your own reviews.
