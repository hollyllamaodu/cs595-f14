Group Pass Purchase

   [66]Register as a Group and Save

   If you plan to register five or more attendees for JavaOne 2014, take
   advantage of the group purchase option. Purchases must be prepaid by
   credit card; the purchaser will receive a priority code for each
   registration purchased. The purchaser can then give out the priority
   codes to whomever will be attending (from their company or user group,
   for example), and people can register at their convenience using the
   priority code that they have been given.

   Register between five to thirteen attendees and receive a savings of up
   to 20 percent off the price of each registration. Register 14 or more
   attendees and receive a savings of up to 28 percent off. The more
   passes you purchase, the greater the discount. Note: for convenience
   you can use the group purchase option to buy four registrations in a
   single credit card transaction, but only five or more registrations
   earn a discount.

   The following guidelines apply for group purchases:
     * You can purchase five or more passes per order, but you will not
       receive a discount unless you purchase five or more passes.
     * Discounts are not cumulative across multiple orders; discounts are
       based on the quantity being purchased for each individual order.
     * Discounts are not cumulative across conference packages—they apply
       only to the quantity purchased per package per order. For example,
       the purchase of seven (7) full-conference passes to JavaOne and
       seven (7) passes to Oracle OpenWorld does not qualify for the
       14-registration discount.
     * If you purchased codes for more than one event, they should not be
       used together on the same registration record as group pass codes
       are not valid for any Add-On package(s). Any Add-On package(s) can
       be added/processed by contacting the help desk to purchase and add
       to your record.
     * These group pass purchases cannot be combined with other
       offers/discounts.
     * Government special rates are not offered within this discounted
       structure.
     * Payment may only be made by credit card.
     * NO refunds are allowed for any group passes purchased.
     * For any group passes up to four there is no discount.

Visa Invitation Letter

   Within the registration process, you will be asked if you need a letter
   of invitation. Select "Yes", please be prepared to provide your
   passport information. Once your registration is completed, visa letters
   will be processed as soon as the registration is paid in full and all
   of the required information has been received. Please note that visa
   letters will not be processed for Discover packages. Attendees are
   responsible for submitting the visa application to their local
   consulate or embassy.

   This information is intended for visitors traveling from outside the
   United States to attend JavaOne or Oracle OpenWorld 2014 in San
   Francisco, California from September 28 to October 2, 2014 and who will
   remain in the US only on a short-term basis. Note that a valid B-1
