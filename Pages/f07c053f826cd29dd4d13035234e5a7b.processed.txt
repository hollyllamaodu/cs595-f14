Samsung Galaxy S5 vs iPhone 5: 5 Key Differences

   [15]galaxy s5
   This year, many current iPhone 5 owners are going to be in the hunt for
   a brand new smartphone. Once that hunt begins, one of the devices that
   will likely appear on the radar is the Samsung Galaxy S5, the new
   Galaxy S that will arrive in April to tempt both prospective and
   current owners of the iPhone 5.

   In September of 2012, Apple took the stage and announced the brand new
   iPhone 5, its first iPhone with a larger 4-inch display, an aluminum
   design, and 4G LTE data speeds. The device flew off shelves in the
   weeks after its launch as many consumers signed new two year contracts
   in an effort to take advantage of the subsidized price.

   The iPhone 5 is no longer available on the Apple Store but it’s still
   very much available. Consumers can buy it through third-party avenues,
   many of which don’t require a contract. All of this makes the iPhone 5
   relevant and what makes this comparison necessary.

   There are those who might be thinking about ditching the iPhone 5 later
   on this year. There are also those who might be thinking about buying
   the device given how far its price has fallen since launch. And it’s
   these people that likely have their eyes on Samsung’s brand new Galaxy
   S smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S5.

   [INS: :INS]

   Earlier this week, Samsung took the curtain down from around its Galaxy
   S successor, showcasing its hardware and software for the first time.
   Like all smartphones, the Galaxy S5 is made up of many parts, parts
   that prospective buyers will have to weigh against their current or
   future smartphone.

   With that in mind, we want to take a look at how the Galaxy S5 stacks
   up with the iPhone 5. We don’t feel comfortable offering up a full-on
   versus just yet, we need to spend some more time with the Galaxy S5,
   but we do want to detail what we consider the main differences between
   the two devices.

Form Factor

   The first big difference between the iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S5 has
   to be their overall designs. Simply put, they are radically different
   from one another.

   Apple’s iPhone 5 ushered in a new era with its industrial design
   comprised of aluminum and glass. The form factor looks elegant, feels
   like a $199, and does not require a case though we do recommend one for
   those who take their smartphone into rugged environments. The aluminum
   is susceptible to scratches.

   The iPhone 5 does not feature a microSD card slot or a removable back
   but it does offer an extremely portable frame that is just 7.6mm thin
   and weighs just 112 grams. That’s thinner and lighter than most
   smartphones, including the Samsung Galaxy S5.

                      [18]Samsung Galaxy S5 vs iPhone 5
                The Galaxy S5 features a Micro SD card slot.

   The Samsung Galaxy S5′s design is not made out of metal. Instead, it’s
   made out of plastic just like all previous versions of the Galaxy S.
   However this isn’t your typical plastic design. The Galaxy S5 design
   uses a unique perforated pattern on the back cover that Samsung says
   gives it a modern ‘glam’ look. It’s stylish and feels more premium than
   the Galaxy S4′s design but again, it’s not metal.

   Samsung’s plastic designs do afford users some useful features. The
   Galaxy S5 comes with a removable back which means that users can
   install an extended battery for more juice. It also comes with a
   microSD card slot that allows users to expand their storage space.

   The Galaxy S5 is thicker (8.1mm) and heavier (145 grams) than the
   iPhone 5 but there is a good reason why. The Galaxy S5′s design is both
   water and dust resistant, something that it borrows from the design
   found on the Galaxy S4 Active on AT&T. This is simply something that
   the iPhone 5 does not have and it makes the Galaxy S5 appealing to
   those that do like to bring their smartphone into rugged environments.

Display

   The iPhone 5 display might be larger than the iPhone displays that came
   before it but its Retina Display is still only 4-inches in size. That’s
   a lot smaller than the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S5.

                     [19][Used-iPhone-iOS-7-Warning.jpg]

   Samsung’s Galaxy S5 sports a screen that measures 5.1-inches
   diagonally. That’s a lot more real estate and it’s going to make
   watching content, playing games and browsing the web more comfortable
   for a lot of people. Of course, it also means that the overall size of
   the phone is a lot larger than the iPhone 5 but that’s going to be a
   manageable trade off for most.

                        [20][DSC_0358-L-620x412.jpg]

   The Galaxy S5 display also offers 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution at 432
   pixels-per-inch. The iPhone 5 does not offer full HD resolution to its
   users which is also a bit of a drawback.

Camera

   We found the iPhone 5 8MP camera to be one of the best on the market.
   In 2012 and for some of 2013. Camera technology though is moving at an
   extremely fast pace and manufacturers are doing their best to keep up
   with the times.

             [21][Samsung-Galaxy-S5-camera-Features-620x410.jpg]
     The Samsung Galaxy S5 camera features three new enhancements and a
          bigger sensor that should deliver better looking photos.

   Samsung’s Galaxy S5 camera is a 16MP camera sensor that offers
   high-resolution photos but also offers some other perks that the iPhone
   5 camera simply does not have.

   The camera comes with an extremely fast autofocus that allows users to
   focus in just 0.3 seconds, something that isn’t found on Apple’s iPhone
   from 2012. It also comes with advanced HDR which allows users to
   actually see the final image on screen before the shutter is hit.
   Again, something that the iPhone 5 doesn’t have.

                [22][iPhone-5S-Rumor-Roundup-001-575x377.jpg]

   We should also point out that the Galaxy S5 is coming with some
   additions to Samsung’s camera application, an app that we consider to
   be one of the best around. The camera app inside iOS 7 is a big
   improvement but it still isn’t as feature-rich as Samsung’s.

Home Button

   It was the iPhone 5s, not the iPhone 5, that introduced Touch ID inside
   the home button. For those that aren’t familiar, Touch ID is the
   fingerprint sensor that is embedded on the iPhone 5s’ home button. The
   iPhone 5 does not have this extra layer of security and convenience and
   instead relies on a normal home button.

        [23][Samsung-Galaxy-S5-Fingerprint-Reader-Unlock-620x489.jpg]
                 Use a fingerprint to unlock the Galaxy S5.

   Samsung took a page out of Apple’s book with its Galaxy S5. The device
   features a fingerprint reader embedded inside of its own home button
   which also provides easier access to the home screen and more
   protection for the phone.

Software

   The last key difference pertains to the software found on board these
   two devices. We’ve already mentioned the difference between the two
   camera applications but that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

   iOS 7 and Samsung’s version of Android 4.4.2 KitKat, which features its
   TouchWiz UI over the top, not only look nothing alike but they offer
   different functionality as well. Those who aren’t familiar with iOS 7
   can take a look at it in the video below.

            IFRAME: [24]//www.youtube.com/embed/O7Ea-72I8QY?rel=0

   [INS: :INS]

   There are simply too many differences to count so we’ll focus on a few
   of the features that the Galaxy S5 is bringing along with it, features
   that the iPhone 5 simply does not have on board.

   One of the key features that the Galaxy S5 will have on board is
   something called “Ultra Power Saving Mode” which will turn the display
   to black and white and will also turn off all unnecessary features in
   an effort to conserve battery life. It’s a feature that Samsung claims
   will save users a ton of battery life in the long run.

                  [25][IMG_20140224_151351-L-620x4651.jpg]

   It also comes with something called Kids Mode that allows parents to
   hand over their smartphone to their young ones without anything
   catastrophic happening to their data. These features and more can be
   seen in the video below.
